NhlSetMarker

   Sets the markers for a given list of marker indexes and workstations.

Prototype

        function NhlSetMarker (
                wks            [*] : graphic,
                marker_indexes [*] : integer,
                marker_strings [*] : string,
                font_num       [*] : integer,
                xoffset        [*] : numeric,
                yoffset        [*] : numeric,
                aspect_ratio   [*] : numeric,
                size           [*] : numeric,
                angle          [*] : numeric
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An array of NCL Workstation identifiers. The identifiers are ones returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling
   create to create a Workstation object.

   marker_indexes

   An array of marker indexes (call the length nmarkers).
   marker_strings

   A list of strings of length nmarkers indicating the markers to create.
   font_num

   A scalar or 1D array of length nmarkers containing font table numbers indicating which font table to use for each marker
   string.
   xoffset
   yoffset

   Scalars or 1D arrays of length nmarkers that are the X and Y offsets of the markers. The values must be between -1 and 1.
   Set to 0.0 if you don't want to offset the marker.
   aspect_ratio

   A scalar or 1D array of length nmarkers that is the aspect ratio of each marker (must be greater than 0). A value greater
   than 1 stretches the marker in the vertical direction, and a value less than 1 stretches it in the horizontal direction.
   Set this to 1.0 to get the default aspect ratio.
   size

   A scalar or 1D array of length nmarkers that is a size multiplier for the default marker size (must be greater than 0). A
   value of 2 doubles the marker size, and value of 0.5 halves the marker size. Set this to 1.0 to get the default size.
   angle

   A scalar or 1D array of length nmarkers that is the angle at which to rotate each marker counter-clockwise; it must be
   greater than or equal to 0. Set this to 0.0 for no rotation.

Description

   For the marker table of each workstation in wks, this procedure sets the given indexes to the marker defined for that
   index.

   We recommend that you use the NhlNewMarker function instead, as it doesn't require that you give it a list of marker
   indexes. It just adds the marker to the end of the current marker table, and returns a new list of indexes.

   For more information on how to create a new marker, see the description section for NhlNewMarker.
