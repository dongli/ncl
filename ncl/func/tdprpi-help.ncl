tdprpi

   Retrieves the parallelogram coordinates of a point in the reference parallelogram, given a point in the projection plane
   (for use with selected TDPACK routines.)

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function tdprpi (
                xyi2d [2] : float
        )

        return_val [2] :  float

Arguments

   xyi2d

   A float array of 2 elements specifying the coordinates of a point in the projection plane.

Return value

   A float array of two elements containing the parallelogram coordinates of that point in the reference parallelogram that
   projects into (xyi2d(0), xyi2d(1)).

Description

   This function is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDPRPI for a full description of this function.
