f2foshv

   Interpolates a vector quantity on a fixed grid (including pole points) to a fixed-offset grid.

Prototype

        procedure f2foshv (
                ureg  : numeric,
                vreg  : numeric,
                uoff  : float,    ; or double
                voff  : float     ; or double
        )

Arguments

   ureg
   vreg

   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. The values must be in
   ascending latitude order.
   uoff
   voff

   (output)
   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. Values will be in
   ascending latitude order.

   The arrays must be the same size as the ureg and vreg arrays, except the latitude dimension must have one less element.

   Since f2foshv is a procedure, the user must explicitly preallocate memory for these return arrays.

Description

   f2foshv interpolates a vector pair on a fixed grid (ureg,vreg) (including pole points) to a fixed-offset grid (uoff,voff)
   using spherical harmonics (via the Spherepack code). The output array dimensions must be the same as the input array
   dimensions, except jlat1 is replaced by jlat1-1. For example, a 5 degree fixed grid would have dimensions nlata=37,
   nlona=72, and the return fixed-offset grid would have dimensions nlatb=36, nlonb=72.

   Arrays which have dimensions [...] x nlata x nlona should not include the cyclic (wrap-around) points when invoking this
   procedure. For example, if arrays u and v have dimensions nlata = 64 and nlona = 129, where the "129" represents the
   cyclic point, then the user should pass the data to f2foshv via:
  z = f2foshv(u(...,0:nlona-2), v(...,0:nlona-2),...)  ; does not include cyclic points

   This procedure can only be used on grids that span the globe. It cannot be used for limited area grids.

   Please read the caveats that you should be aware of when using spherical harmonic regridding.

   Use f2foshv_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume u and v are dimensioned nt x nlat x nlon, and that they are of type float or double.

   The code below interpolates from a fixed 2.5 degree grid (nlat=73, nlon=144) to a fixed-offset grid with 2.5 degree
   resolution (jlat=72, ilon=144):
  uNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(u) )
  vNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(v) )

  f2foshv (u,v, uNew,vNew)

Errors

   ier is equal to:

     4 or 10 if nlona (ilon) is less than 4
     5 or 10 if nlata (jlat) is less than 3
     8 if nlonb is less than 4
     9 if nlatb is less than 3
