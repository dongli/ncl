get_script_name

   Returns the name of a script of commands provided to NCL for execution.

Prototype

        function get_script_name (
        )

        return_val [1] :  string

Return value

   Returns a singly dimensioned string containing the name of the file of commands, if provided, to NCL for execution.

Description

   This function returns the name of a script of commands that NCL was invoked with, if provided.

   Note: get_script_name was originally an unadvertised function in the shea_util.ncl script. It behaved slightly different
   in that it returned only the prefix of the NCL script name. If you were using this old version and want to duplicate its
   behavior, then use the new built-in get_script_prefix_name function, which doesn't require any script to be loaded in
   order to use it.

   get_script_prefix_name

Examples

   Example 1

   Print the name of the command file provided to NCL. If NCL is invoked as:
% ncl myScript.ncl

   the script itself can announce how NCL was invoked:

  script_name  = get_script_name()  ; string
  print(script_name)                ; Or, just print(get_script_name())

   The following is returned:
myScript.ncl

   Example 2

   If no script is provided to NCL, the default missing value for type string is returned. If NCL is invoked as:
% ncl

   the function will return:
  print(get_script_name())
