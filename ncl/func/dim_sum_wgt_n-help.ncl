dim_sum_wgt_n

   Computes the weighted sum of a variable's given dimension at all other dimensions.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function dim_sum_wgt_n (
                x       : numeric,
                w   [*] : numeric,
                opt [1] : integer,
                dim     : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality. Missing values are indicated by the _FillValue attribute.
   w

   A one dimensional array of weights. The length must be the same as the dim-th dimension of x.
   opt

   A scalar: (a) opt=0 means compute the weighted sum only if all values are not missing; (b) opt=1 means compute the
   weighted sum of all non-missing values; (c) opt>1 means to return the sum only if the number of non-missing values is
   greater-than or equal to opt.
   dim

   A scalar, the dimension of "x" of which to do the weighted sum across.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality will be the same as all but the dim-th dimension of the input variable. The dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   The dim_sum_wgt_n function computes the weighted sum of all elements of the dim-th dimension for each index of the
   remaining dimensions.

   Basically, the following is done:

    xAvg = SUM [x*w]/SUM[w]

   The weighting is strictly positional. EG: If x@_FillValue=1e20, and the rightmost dimension is of size 5 and the values
   are (/3.7, 1e20, 14.3, 1e20, 7.1 /) with weights (/1,3,5,3,1/) then the result will be
      (3.7*1 + 14.3*5 + 7.1*1) = 82.3

   Use dim_sum_wgt_n_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let z(12,nlat,mlon) contain monthly means and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Compute the
   weighted annual sum (total) at each lat/lon point.
    wgt = (/0.08493151, 0.076712325, 0.08493151, 0.08219178 \   ; same size as dimension "time"
           ,0.08493151, 0.08219178 , 0.08493151, 0.08493151 \
           ,0.08219178, 0.08493151 , 0.08219178, 0.08493151 /)
    pTot = dim_sum_wgt_n(precip, wgt, 0, 0)    ; ==> pTot(nlat,mlon)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_sum_wgt_n_Wrap function.

   Example 2

   Let T(time,lev,lat,lon). Compute the weighted vertical sum total at each time/lat/lon point.
    wgt = (/50,50,100,100,100,50,25,10/) ; same size as dimension "lev"

    Tsum = dim_sum_wgt_n( T, wgt, 0, 1 )   ; ==> Tsum(time,lat,lon)
