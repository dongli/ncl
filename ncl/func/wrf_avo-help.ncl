wrf_avo

   Calculates absolute vorticity from WRF model output.

Prototype

        function wrf_avo (
                u       : numeric,
                v       : numeric,
                msfu    : numeric,
                msfv    : numeric,
                msfm    : numeric,
                cor     : numeric,
                dx  [1] : numeric,
                dy  [1] : numeric,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   u

   X-wind component. An array whose rightmost three dimensions are bottom_top x south_north x west_east_stag.
   v

   Y-wind component. An array whose rightmost three dimensions are bottom_top x south_north_stag x west_east, and whose
   leftmost dimensions are the same as u's.
   msfu

   Map scale factor on u-grid. An array whose rightmost two dimensions are the same as u's. If it contains additional
   leftmost dimensions, they must be the same as the u and v arrays.
   msfv

   Map scale factor on v-grid. An array with the same number of dimensions as msfu, whose rightmost two dimensions are the
   same as v's. If it contains additional leftmost dimensions, they must be the same as the u and v arrays.
   msfm

   Map scale factor on mass grid. An array with the same number of dimensions as msfu and msfv, whose rightmost two
   dimensions are south_north x west_east. If it contains additional leftmost dimensions, they must be the same as the u and
   v arrays.
   cor

   Coriolis sine latitude term. An array of the same dimensionality as msfm.
   dx

   A scalar representing the grid spacing in X.
   dy

   A scalar representing the grid spacing in Y.
   opt

   An integer option, not in use yet. Set to 0.

Return value

   Absolute vorticity at each grid point. The rightmost three dimensions will be bottom_top x south_north x west_east, and
   the leftmost dimensions, if any, will be the same as u's. The array will contain the same named dimensions as u and v;
   otherwise, the rightmost two dimensions will be named "south_north" and "west_east". The type will be double if any of
   the input is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   This function returns absolute vorticity, which is the sum of the relative vorticity at each grid point and the Coriolis
   parameter at the latitude.

   The return variable will contain two attributes:

     return_val@description = "Absolute Vorticity"
     return_val@units = "10-5 s-1"

   Questions on this function should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Note: for WRF variable names and their definitions, you can easily check them by using "ncl_filedump":
  ncl_filedump wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc

   Example 1

 nc_file = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")
 U    = nc_file->U
 V    = nc_file->V
 MSFU = nc_file->MAPFAC_U
 MSFV = nc_file->MAPFAC_V
 MSFM = nc_file->MAPFAC_M
 COR  = nc_file->F

 DX = nc_file@DX
 DY = nc_file@DY

 avo = wrf_avo( U, V, MSFU, MSFV, MSFM, COR, DX, DY, 0)

   Example 2

   The function wrf_user_getvar (available in the $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl script) can also be
   used to calculate many diagnostics in one step.

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")


  avo = wrf_user_getvar(a,"avo",-1)  ; calculate avo for all times in file
