wmvectmap

   Draws vectors over maps.

Prototype

        procedure wmvectmap (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                lat     : float,
                lon     : float,
                u       : float,
                v       : float
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier specifying where you want to draw your vectors. The wks identifier is one returned either
   from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   lat
   lon

   Arrays of any size and shape containing the latitudes and longitudes (in degrees) at which the vectors are to be drawn.
   These arrays must be the same size and shape as the u and v arrays.
   u
   v

   Arrays containing the longitudinal and latitudinal vector components.

Description

   The procedure wmvectmap uses the vector functions from the Wmap package to draw vectors over maps.

   This procedure is primarily to be used for drawing vectors that are defined on non-gridded data; if you are drawing
   vectors over a map that are defined on gridded data, then you could use a vector plot with vcGlyphStyle set to an
   approproate style.

   Vectors will be drawn at the specified locations using the current map transformation (i.e. on the most recently created
   map). The vector directions will be adjusted to point in concert with the map projection. For example, a vector with u=0.
   and v=80. will point toward the north pole rather than necessarily straight up.

   There are several parameters that control the vector apperance. The parameters VRS and VRN establish the relationship
   between vector lengths [the value sqrt(u*u+v*v)] and the length of the vector displayed on the plot. By default a vector
   length of 10. gets mapped to a line that is 2% of the maximum width of the output plot. You will most likely want to
   change these values.

   To set parameters to control the appearance of a vector, such as its color, linewidth, and so forth, use the wmsetp
   procedure. To retrieve parameter values, use the function wmgetp.

   The parameters applicable to wmvectmap are:

    1. VCH - controls the vector arrow head size
    2. VCC - controls the vector color.
    3. VCW - controls the linewidth scale factor.
    4. VVA - controls the angle between the arrow and tail

   The procedure wmvectmap does not call frame.

   Vectors are not plotted where the input data has missing values.
