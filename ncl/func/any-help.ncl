any

   Returns True if any of the values of its input evaluate as True.

Prototype

        function any (
                logical_array  : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  logical

Arguments

   logical_array

   A logical array of any dimensionality.

Description

   The any function returns a single logical scalar value if any of the non-missing value elements of the logical_array
   parameter are True or can be evaluated as True.

   This function is useful for changing multidimensional results from logical expressions into a single scalar value, which
   is required by the if statement. All numeric values can be coerced to a logical value. Values that are 0 are interpreted
   as False and values that are non-zero are interpreted as True.

   Use the all function if you want True to be returned only if all of the input evaluates as True.

Examples

   Example 1
  x = new(5,float,-999)
  x = (/1.,2.,-999,4.,5./)

  print(any(x.ge.4))             ; should be True
  print(any(x.lt.0))             ; should be False
  print(any(x.gt.2.and.x.lt.4))  ; should be False

   Example 2
  if(any(ismissing(x))) then
    print("x contains one or more missing values, cannot continue.")
    return
  end if
