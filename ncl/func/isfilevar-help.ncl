isfilevar

   Checks if specified file variables are defined in a file.

Prototype

        function isfilevar (
                thefile [1] : file,
                varnames    : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(varnames)] :  logical

Arguments

   thefile

   reference to a file. It is created using addfile. Thus it must be a supported file format.
   varnames

   an array of strings of any dimension

Return value

   The output is a logical array with the same dimensions as the varnames parameter.

Description

   For each element in the varnames parameter, isfilevar returns True if the variable is present on the file referenced by
   thefile and False if not. If the parameter thefile is not a valid file, then a single missing value is returned.

Examples

   Example 1: If a variable named X resides in the file referenced by f, read it to memory using:
  f = addfile ("dummy.hdf", "r")
  if (isfilevar(f, "X")) then
    x = f->X
  end if

   Example 2: Loop through a series of possible variable names and read the first occurrence of that variable name. Use the
   NCL break keyword to exit the loop. The '$' character is used to allow string substitution in the variable name:

  rotaName = (/"ANGLE", "angle", "UTAN", "utan", "ROTA", "rota" /)
  do i=0,dimsizes(rotaName)-1
    if (isfilevar(f,rotaName(i))) then
      rot = ndtooned(f->$rotaName(i)$)
      break           ; exit from do loop
    end if
  end do
