ut_inv_calendar

   Converts a UT-referenced date to a mixed Julian/Gregorian date (deprecated; use cd_inv_calendar).

Prototype

        function ut_inv_calendar (
                year       : integer,
                month      : integer,
                day        : integer,
                hour       : integer,
                minute     : integer,
                second     : numeric,
                units      : string,
                option [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(year)] :  double

Arguments

   year

   An array or scalar integer representing years.
   month

   An array or scalar integer representing months. Must be same size as year.
   day

   An array or scalar integer representing days. Must be same size as year.
   hour

   An array or scalar integer representing hours. Must be same size as year.
   minute

   An array or scalar integer representing minutes. Must be same size as year.
   second

   An array or scalar numeric representing seconds. Must be same size as year.
   units

   A string representing a formatted time unit specification. Valid strings include:

seconds
minutes
hours
days
months
years

   The following units qualifiers may also be used:

since
after
from
ref

   Examples:

time@units = "days after 0049-09-01 00:00:00"
time@units = "hours ref 1-1-1 00:00:0.0"
time@units = "months from 1-1-1"

   option

   The actual value of this variable currently has no effect, but it can optionally contain a "calendar" attribute. See
   description below.

Return value

   A double array of the same size as year. Contains a units attribute that contains the temporal units.

Description

   Unidata no longers supports the internal code that ut_inv_calendar is based on. We therefore strongly recommend that you
   use the cd_inv_calendar function instead. Important note: ut_inv_calendar and cd_inv_calendar treat "year 0" differently.
   See the caveats below.

   Converts a UT-referenced date to a mixed Julian/Gregorian date. As of version 5.1.0, if the option variable contains a
   "calendar" attribute with one of the following values:

     * "360", "360_day"
     * "365", "365_day"
     * "noleap"

   then this calendar will be used.

   Thanks to David W. Pierce, the developer of ncview, for providing these calendar additions.

   Important notes

     * ut_calendar is based on an external software package called UDUNITS-2, which has phased out the support for these
       types of calendaring routines. Caution should be used when using this routine with special calendars like the above,
       or negative values.
     * As of NCL version 5.2.0, this code is being linked against UDUNITS-2, which has a dependency on some xml files that
       come installed with NCL. There's a bug in 5.2.0 that if you are setting the environment variable UDUNITS_PATH, you
       may see the error message:

  warning:ut_inv_calendar: Invalid specification string. Missing values will
  be returned.

       There are two possible work-arounds:
         1. Set the UDUNITS2_XML_PATH environment variable:
   setenv UDUNITS2_XML_PATH $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/udunits/udunits2.xml
or
   export UDUNITS2_XML_PATH=$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/udunits/udunits2.xml

         2. Unset the UDUNITS_PATH environment variable before you run NCL.
     * In V5.1.0/5.1.1 there's a bug if you use one of the above calendars. You will get an error:
  Error, udu_lib_version not set to value value: -1

       A work-around is to call ut_calendar first with dummy data, which internally forces "udu_lib_version" to be correctly
       initialized. You can use these three lines:
  dum_time       = 17522904
  dum_time@units = "hours since 1-1-1 00:00:0.0"
  dum_date       = ut_calendar(dum_time, 0)

   To quote the UDUNITS-2 man page:

     The udunits(3) package uses a mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar system. Dates prior to 1582-10-15 are assumed to use the
     Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BCE and is based on a year that is exactly 365.25 days
     long. Dates on and after 1582-10-15 are assumed to use the Gregorian calendar, which was introduced on that date and
     is based on a year that is exactly 365.2425 days long. (A year is actually approximately 365.242198781 days long.)
     Seemingly strange behavior of the udunits(3) package can result if a user-given time interval includes the changeover
     date. For example, ut_calendar and ut_inv_calendar can be used to show that 1582-10-15 *preceded* 1582-10-14 by 9
     days.

   The following excerpt from the UDUNITS-2 documentation explains the time@units encoding by example:

    The specification:

        seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00

    indicates seconds  since October 8th, 1992 at 3 hours, 15 minutes and
    42.5 seconds in the afternoon in the time zone which is six hours to
    the west of Coordinated Universal Time (i.e.  Mountain Daylight Time).
    The time zone specification can also be written without a colon using
    one or two-digits.

Examples

   Example 1

   To see how the inverse function ut_inv_calendar works, simply take the output from ut_calendar and plug it back into
   ut_inv_calendar:

  date = ut_inv_calendar(year,month,day,hour,minute,second,time@units, 0)

   The arrays date and time should be identical.
