rgbyiq

   Converts RGB color values to YIQ values.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.0.0 and later.

Prototype

        function rgbyiq (
                rgb  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   rgb

   An array of Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color values. This array can be of any shape, but the rightmost dimension must be 3
   for specifying the RGB values. The Red, Green, and Blue values are intensities in the range [0.,1.].

Return value

   The returned value is an array of the same dimension and dimension sizes as the input array. The input RGB values will
   have been replaced with their YIQ equivalents. If any values in the input array are double precision, the returned array
   will be double precision.

Description

   This function determines the YIQ equivalents to RGB color values. The YIQ color model is used in U.S. commercial analog
   television and is a recoding of RGB for transmission efficeincy.

   The Y component (luma) is the only component used by black and white TVs. Y minimizes the effect of two colors appearing
   different to the human eye but mapping to similar monochrome intensities. Y values range between 0. and 1. inclusive.

   The I (in-phase) component is in the range [-0.6, 0.6]. It attains its maximum when the input RGB triple is (1.,0.,0.);
   it attains its minimum when the input RGB triple is (0.,1.,1.) .

   The Q (quadrature) component is in the range [-0.53, 0.53]. Q attains its maximum when the input RGB triple is (1.,0.,1.)
   and it attains its minimum when the input triple is (0.,1.,0.).

   Missing values are not honored.

Examples

   Example 1

   The following:
begin
  yiq = rgbyiq((/1.0, 0.0, 1.0/))
  print (yiq)
end

   produces:

   Example 2

   The following:
begin
  rgb = (/ (/1.d, 0.d, 1.d/), (/0.d, 1.d, 0.d/) /)
  yiq = rgbyiq(rgb)
  print (yiq)
