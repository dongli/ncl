paleo_outline

   Creates continental outlines from model orography data.

Prototype

        procedure paleo_outline (
                oro    [*][*] : numeric,
                lat       [*] : numeric,
                lon       [*] : numeric,
                landvalue [1] : float,
                basename      : string
        )

        return_val

Arguments

   oro

   A two-dimensional array of orography values. Dimensions are lat x lon.
   lat

   A one-dimensional array of latitudes. Must be the same size as the leftmost dimension of oro.
   lon

   A one-dimensional array of longitudes. Must be the same size as the rightmost dimension of oro.
   landvalue

   A scalar float that indicates the value of land in oro.
   basename

   A string equal to the base name for the two map files which will be created (i.e. "jurassic"). This can include the path
   where the files should be created (i.e. "./eocene").

Description

   This procedure creates continental outlines from model orography data for use in paleo-geographic plots, and writes the
   data to two files which can then be accessed via the mpDataSetName resource to draw the new outlines. The two files will
   be called basename.lines and basename.names.

   Once these files are created, you can put them in the directory $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database, and then you can load
   them using the mpDataSetName resource, and you don't have to indicate the path to the files or regenerate the files every
   time.

Examples

   Example 1


  oro = f->ORO(0,:,:)         ; orography data
  lat = f->lat
  lon = f->lon
  landmask = 1                ; land value in oro
  basename = "./EOCENE"       ; files EOCENE.lines and EOCENE.names created

  paleo_outline (oro,lat,lon,landmask,basename)
  ...

  ; the following two resources are required to load and apply the
  ; paleo continental outline.
  res@mpDataBaseVersion = "Ncarg4_1"
  res@mpDataSetName     = basename

  plot = gsn_csm_contour_map_ce (wks,data,res)
