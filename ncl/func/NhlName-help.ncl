NhlName

   Retrieves the name of one or more NCL objects.

Prototype

        function NhlName (
                objects [*] : graphic
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(objects)] :  string

Arguments

   objects

   An array of one or more instances of NCL objects. NCL objects are created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by
   calling the NCL create language construct.

Description

   This function returns the individual name given to each object in objects. If the object was created using one of the GSN
   functions, this name is set internally. If the object was created by using the NCL create language construct, then the
   name is the one in double quotes.

   If any item of objects is either missing or is an invalid object, the result is a missing value.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example creates a workstation, an XY plot, and a text string, and prints the name of all of them using NhlName:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
;
; Create workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

;
; Create a data object.
;
  npts = 500
  x    = fspan(0,npts-1,npts)
  y    = 500.+ 0.9 * x * sin(0.031415926535898*x)
  xy   = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,False)

  print(NhlName((/wks,xy/)))   ; Should be (/"test_x11","test_xy"/).

;
; Use the "create" construct to create a text string.
; In this case, NhlName will return the name that
; follows the "create" keyword ("text1").
;
 text = create "text1" textItemClass wks
    "txString"      : "This is a string"
    "txPosYF"       : 0.5
    "txPosYF"       : 0.9
  end create

  print(NhlName(text))   ; Should be "text1".
