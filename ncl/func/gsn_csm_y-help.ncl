gsn_csm_y

   Creates and draws an XY plot, using index values for the X axis.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_y (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                y       : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   y

   The Y coordinates of the curve(s). If y is two-dimensional, then the leftmost dimension determines the number of curves.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the XY plot created is returned. The id of the data object is also returned as an attribute called data.
   This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws an XY plot on the given workstation, using index values for the X axis. By default, the
   tickmarks will point outward.

   If y has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value. If y has a "long_name" and/or "units"
   attribute, these will be used to label the Y axis, unless the tickmarks on the Y axis are explicitly labeled using
   tmYLMode resource.

   If gsnYRefLine is set to some value, then a reference line will be drawn at that value.

   If gsnAboveYRefLineColor and/or gsnBelowYRefLineColor are set, then the areas between the Y reference line and the
   Y-curve are filled in the appropriate color.

   There are other special gsn resources that apply to XY plots. See the gsn resource page for a full list.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
