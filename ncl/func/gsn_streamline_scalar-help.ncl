gsn_streamline_scalar

   Creates and draws a streamline plot colored by a given a scalar field.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_streamline_scalar (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                u    [*][*] : numeric,
                v    [*][*] : numeric,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the streamline plot; must be two-dimensional.
   data

   The data for which to color the streamlines by; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the streamline plot created is returned. The id of the streamline data object is returned as an attribute
   called vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an attribute called sfdata. This is useful if you want
   to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a streamline plot colored by a scalar field on the given workstation.

   If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   In NCL V6.1.0, this function was updated to automatically create a labeblar if stMonoLineColor is set to False.
