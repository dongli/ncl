fbinseqSwap1

   Byte swaps Fortran sequential files (deprecated).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        procedure fbinseqSwap1 (
                in_file  [1] : string,
                out_file [1] : string,
                type     [1] : string,
                dims     [*] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  file

Arguments

   in_file

   Name of input file.
   out_file

   Name of output file.
   type

   The type of the data on in_file (e.g. "float")
   dims

   A one-dimensional array or equal to the dimensionality of the input data.

Description

   Note: this function is deprecated. You can now use the "ReadByteOrder" and "WriteByteOrder" options in setfileoption to
   indicate how the various NCL binary read/write functions should read and write files.

   Byte swaps Fortran sequential files. It requires that all records in the file be the same type and dimension. The user
   must provide the dimensionality of each record, but not necessarily the number of records. If the wrong dimensions are
   input, the data will be distorted.

Examples

   Example 1

   In the following, N is record length [eg N=1000 , (/nlat,mlon/) ]
   load $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl

   fbinseqSwap1("foo.input", "foo.output", "float",  N)
