NhlNewColor

   Allocates new workstation color indexes.

Prototype

        function NhlNewColor (
                workstations [*] : graphic,
                red          [*] : float,
                green        [*] : float,
                blue         [*] : float
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(workstations)][dimsizes(red)] :  integer

Arguments

   workstations

   An array of NCL Workstation identifiers. The identifiers are ones returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling
   create to create a Workstation object.

   red
   green
   blue

   Arrays of floating-point values between 0 and 1 inclusive. They must all be the same length.

Return value

   The color indexes allocated can be different for each workstation identifier, so the return array of color indexes is
   dimensioned nwks x nrgb , where nwks is the length of workstations, and nrgb is the length of the red, green, blue
   arrays.

Description

   For the color map of each workstation in workstations, this function allocates color indexes for every given red, green,
   blue triplet.

   This function is different than the NhlSetColor procedure in that you are not required to input color indexes for which
   to put the new colors.

   If you are trying to add a color to a color map that already has 256 colors in it, you will get an error. Try using
   NhlSetColor in this case.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example draws a filled contour plot over a map. It uses a "rainbow" colormap which has no gray in it. This causes
   the continents to be drawn in white. The NhlNewColor function is used to add gray to the end of the colormap.
