destroy

   Destroys objects from NCL.

Prototype

        procedure destroy (
                objects  : graphic
        )

Arguments

   objects

   An array of one or more object instances to be destroyed. Objects are created by using one of the many gsn functions, or
   by calling the NCL create language construct.

Description

   Each element of the objects parameter is destroyed and replaced with the default missing value for NCL objects. Unlike
   the delete command, destroy does not delete the variable referencing the objects.

Examples

   Example 1

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
;
; Create workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

;
; Create a data object.
;
  npts = 500
  x    = fspan(0,npts-1,npts)
  y    = 500.+ 0.9 * x * sin(0.031415926535898*x)

;
; Draw XY plot and advance frame.
;
  xy = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,False)

;
; Clean up.
;
  destroy(xy)
  destroy(wks)
;
; Note that we can still print these variables, but they will contain
; missing values.
;
  print(xy)
  print(wks)
end
