list_procfuncs

   Lists all of the currently defined NCL functions and procedures and their argument lists.

Prototype

        procedure list_procfuncs (
        )

Description

   This procedure lists all of the currently defined NCL procedures and functions, the type of each parameter, and the
   dimensionality of each parameter. If run at the command line, this procedure invokes a pager for scrolling through the
   list. The pager is either "more" or whatever the user's PAGER environment variable is set to.

Examples

   Example 1

   There's not really a whole lot you can do with this procedure, except to use it:
begin
  list_procfuncs
end

   It may be useful to pipe this output to a file that you can then search.
