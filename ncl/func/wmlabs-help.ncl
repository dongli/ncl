wmlabs

   Plots special symbols and icons for daily weather.

Prototype

        procedure wmlabs (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                x   [*] : float,
                y   [*] : float,
                sym [1] : string
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier specifying where you want to draw your symbols. The wks identifier is one returned either
   from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   x

   A one-dimensional array specifying X-coordinate values of points where symbols are to be drawn. If the internal parameter
   EZF is set to a non-default value (i.e. this function is being used in conjunction with an NCL mapping function), then
   the X-coordinate values are assumed to be latitudes expressed in degrees. Otherwise the X-coordinates are assumed to be
   in NCL data units.
   y

   A one-dimensional array specifying Y-coordinate values of points where symbols are to be drawn. If the internal parameter
   EZF is set to a non-default value (i.e. this function is being used in conjunction with an NCL mapping function), then
   the Y-coordinate values are assumed to be longitudes expressed in degrees. Otherwise the X-coordinates are assumed to be
   in NCL data units.
   sym

   Specifies what symbol is to be drawn.

Description

   The procedure wmlabs uses the WMLABS routine from the Wmap package to plot special symbols and icons for daily weather.

   The procedure wmlabs is used to draw special weather map symbols, such as high and low pressure indicators, arrows, dots,
   weather icons, cloud symbols, lightning bolts, and a sun.

   For details on drawing weather symbols, see the section on drawing symbols in the wmap documentation for the lower level
   utilities.

   Certain parameters may be set to control the appearance of the various symbols. The procedure wmsetp is used to set
   parameter values, and the function wmgetp is used to retrieve parameter values. The parameters applicable to wmlabs are:
   EZF - to flag that wmlabs is to be used in conjunction with an NCL mapping function
   ARS, AWC, ARD, ASC, AOC, ARC - for arrows
   SHT, HIF, HIB, HIS, HIC - for high symbols
   SHT, LOF, LOB, LOS - for low symbols
   ARS, AWC, ARD, ASC, AOC, ARL - for arrows
   COL, SHT, - for icons
   DBC, DTC, DTS - for dots
   CC1, CC2, CC3 - for clouds
   LC1, LC2, LC3 - for lightning bolts
   SC1, SC2, SC3, SC4 - for suns

   The procedure wmlabs does not call frame.
