readAsciiTable

   Reads an ASCII file given the number of lines at the beginning and end of the file to ignore.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function readAsciiTable (
                filename   : string,
                ncol       : integer or long,
                data_type  : string,
                opt
        )

        return_val [*] :  data_type

Arguments

   filename

   The filename to read.
   ncol

   A scalar representing the number of columns in the file.

   As of version 6.0.0, this can be of type integer or long.
   data_type

   A string representing the type of data in the table (i.e "float").
   opt

   If type integer or long, opt can have one or two elements. The first element specifices the number of lines (rows) to
   ignore at the beginning of the file, and the second element, if it exists, specifies the number of lines to ignore at the
   end of the file.

   If opt is a string, then it is a sequence of characters that terminate a variable number of header rows. Currently this
   just checks character sequences starting in column 0.

Return value

   A one or two-dimensional array dimensioned nrows by ncol. It will be of type data_type.

Description

   This function reads an ASCII file and returns the table data after the header portion, and before the footer portion (if
   specified).

   Note that this function can be extremely slow if you have thousands of lines of data. This is because this function has
   to read the file in as an array of strings, first to get the header information and then again to get the values. Reading
   thousands of lines of strings can be very slow. In this case, it may be better to use asciiread and reshape the data into
   a 2D array yourself. See the "Reading ASCII data" examples page for information on how to read a large ASCII file that
   has header and/or footer data.
