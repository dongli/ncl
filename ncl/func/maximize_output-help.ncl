maximize_output

   Maximizes the sizes of a series of plots drawn in a single frame.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure maximize_output (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                res [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied. The only two resources recognized by this procedure are gsnDraw and gsnFrame.

Description

   This procedure takes a workstation (that has several plots drawn on it), calculates the device coordinates needed to
   maximize the plots on a PS or PDF workstation, and then sets these device coordinates so that the plots are draw as big
   as possible without skewing their aspect ratios or falling off the page.

   The plots are drawn and the frame is advanced by default, unless gsnDraw and/or gsnFrame are set to False.

Examples

   For an example, see panel example 20.
