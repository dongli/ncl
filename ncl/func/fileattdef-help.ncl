fileattdef

   Defines global (file) attributes associated with a supported file.

Prototype

        procedure fileattdef (
                thefile [1] : file,
                variable
        )

Arguments

   thefile

   The reference to the file that you want to write the attributes to. This reference must be created by the addfile
   function.
   variable

   A variable of any type whose attributes will be copied to thefile as global attributes

Description

   Given a reference to a file, fileattdef is used to define attributes applicable to the file as a whole. These are
   sometimes known as global file attributes. Using this procedure is much more efficient than writing a file's attributes
   one at a time.

Examples

   Write several global attributes to the file "myfile.nc":
  ncf = addfile("myfile.nc","c")
;
;
; For a nicer looking netCDF, create a "new line" character.
; This is not necessary.
;
  nl = integertochar(10)  ; newline character
;
; Define global attributes.
;
; globalAtt can be of any type. Here logical is used by convention.
;
  globalAtt             = True

  globalAtt@history     = nl+\
      systemfunc("date") + ": ncl < TQ_NCEP2nc.ncl"

  globalAtt@sigma_level = nl+\
      "Pressure at a grid point (lon(i),lat(j),lev(k)) is computed    "+nl+\
      "using the formula:                                             "+nl+\
      "           p(i,j,k) = B(k)*PS(i,j)                             "+nl+\
      "where B and PS are contained in the variables whose names      "+nl+\
      "are given respectively by the attributes B_var and PS_var      "+nl+\
      "of the vertical coordinate variable.                             "

  globalAtt@center      = ps@center
  globalAtt@model       = ps@model
  globalAtt@title       = "T, Q, and PS from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data"
  globalAtt@source      = "NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data"
  globalAtt@Conventions = "CF"
  fileattdef( ncf, globalAtt )

   "ncdump myfile.nc" produces the following output:
netcdf myfile {

// global attributes:
                :Conventions = "CF" ;
                :source = "NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data" ;

    "of the vertical coordinate variable.                             " ;
                :history = "\n",
