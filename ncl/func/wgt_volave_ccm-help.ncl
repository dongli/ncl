wgt_volave_ccm

   Calculates the volume average of a quantity from the CCM using weights.

Prototype

        function wgt_volave_ccm (
                q        : numeric,
                wgtz     : numeric,
                wgty [*] : numeric,
                wgtx [*] : numeric,
                opt      : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   q

   An array of 3 or more dimensions containing the data to be averaged. The rightmost dimensions should correspond to
   "level" (lev), "latitude" (lat), and "longitude" (lon) when dealing with quantities on a sphere ([...,],lev,lat,lon), and
   "z", "y", and "x" otherwise ([...,],z,y,x).
   wgtz

   An array dimensioned the same size as q for the atmospheric component of the CCM. Typically, this will be the
   "delta-pressures" as calculated by NCL's dpres_hybrid_ccm function.
   wgty

   A scalar (typically 1.0) or 1-dimensional array of size "lat" (y) containing the weights.
   wgtx

   A scalar (typically 1.0) or 1-dimensional array of size "lon" (x) containing the weights.
   opt

   If opt = 0, the area average is calculated using available non-missing data. If opt = 1, then if any point in q is
   missing, the area average is not computed. In this case, it will be set to the missing value, which is indicated by
   q@_FillValue, or the default missing value if q@_FillValue is not set.

Return value

   Returns a scalar if q is a two dimensional array. Otherwise, the output dimensionality is the same as the leftmost
   dimensions of the input q.

   The return type is floating point if the input is floating point, and double if the input is of type double.

Description

   This function computes the volume average of a quantity from the CCM using weights.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let q(time, lev, lat, lon) be a global array with dimension sizes ktime = 120, nlev = 28, nlat = 64, mlon = 128 and
   wgtp(ktime, nlev, nlat, mlon) be an array containing the "delta-pressures" as computed by the NCL function
   dpres_hybrid_ccm. Let wgty(nlat) be a 1-dimensional array containing gaussian or cosine weights. Assume that no special
   weighting is applied in the longitude (x) direction. Then:
  p0    = 100000.0
  hyai  = f->hyai
  hyai  = f->hyai
  ps    = f->PS
  wgty  = f->gwt
  wgtx  = 1.0
  wgtp  = dpres_hybrid_ccm(ps, p0, hyai, hybi)

  glAve = wgt_volave_ccm(q, wgtp, wgty, 1.0, 0)   ; glAve(ktime)
  delete (wgtp)

   or
  glAve = wgt_volave_ccm (q, dpres_hybrid_ccm(ps,p0,hyai,hybi), wgty, 1.0, 0)

   will calculate the volume (global) average for each time. glAve will be a 1-dimensional array with dimension (ktime =
   120). If a missing value is encountered at any of the two rightmost dimensions, then the result will be set to
   q@_FillValue (opt = 0).

   Example 2

   nhAve = wgt_volave_ccm(q(:, :, 33:nlat - 1,:), wgtp(:, :, 33:nlat - 1, :), \
                          wgty(33:nlat), 1.0, 1)

   will calculate the volume (northern hemisphere) average for each time and level. Standard subscripting is used to subset
   the input global array. nhAve will be a 1-dimensional array with dimension (ktime = 120). If a missing value is
   encountered at any of the two rightmost dimension, it is ignored (equivalent to a weight of 0.0) and the average is
   calculated using available non-missing data (opt = 1).

   Example 3

   Same as above but q, wgtz and wgty must have named dimensions and coordinate variables.
   shAve = wgt_volave_ccm(q(:, 5:7, {lat | -90:0}, :), wgtz(:, 5:7, {lat | -90:0}), \
                           wgty({lat | -90:0}), 1.0, 0)

   will calculate the volume (southern hemisphere) average for each time using levels = 5, 6, 7. Named subscripting and
   standard subscripting are used to subset the input global array. shAve will have dimension (ktime).
