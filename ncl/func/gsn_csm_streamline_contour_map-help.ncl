gsn_csm_streamline_contour_map

   Creates and draws streamlines over a contour plot over a map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_streamline_contour_map (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                u    [*][*] : numeric,
                v    [*][*] : numeric,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the streamline plot; they must be two-dimensional.
   data

   The data for the contour plot. It must be two-dimensional, where the leftmost dimension will be represented on the Y
   (latitude) axis, and the rightmost dimension represented on the X (longitude) axis.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. The id of the streamline plot is returned as an attribute called
   streamline and the id of the contour plot as an attribute called contour. The id of the data object is returned as an
   attribute called vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an attribute called sfdata. This is useful
   if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws streamlines over a contour plot over a map on the given workstation. The default
   projection is a cylindrical equidistant, which you can override by setting the mpProjection resource.

   In order for the streamlines and contours to be overlaid correctly on the map, please see the document "Overlaying data
   on a map".

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to True so that a cyclic point will be added to the data. Set this resource
   to False if your data is not cyclic, or if you have already added the cyclic point in another fashion.

   If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   For the contour plot, if the resource cnFillOn is set to True, then the following will happen automatically:
     * a labelbar will be automatically added (default horizontal)
     * contour lines and line labels will be turned off
     * the contour information label will be turned off

   If you want to turn the labelbar off, set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the latitude/longitude locations will be labeled (cylindrical equidistant and polar stereographic maps only)
     * the tickmarks will point outward (cylindrical equidistant map only)

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   In NCL V6.1.0, this function was updated to automatically create a labeblar if stMonoLineColor is set to False.
