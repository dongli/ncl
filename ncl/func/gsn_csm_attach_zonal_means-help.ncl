gsn_csm_attach_zonal_means

   Attaches a zonal means plot to a contour/map plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_attach_zonal_means (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                map [1] : graphic,
                data    : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   map

   The identifier returned from calling one of the map plot functions, like gsn_csm_contour_map.
   data

   The data to use for calculating the zonal means. This will likely be the data that was used to generate contours overlaid
   on a map.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the XY/zonal plot created is returned.

Description

   This function creates and attaches a zonal means plot to the right edge of a given map plot. Most likely, it will be used
   to attach a zonal means plot to a plot of contours overlaid on a map. This function produces the same results as setting
   gsnZonalMean to True when calling gsn_csm_contour_map or gsn_csm_contour_map_ce. It should only be used if you need more
   control over the zonal means plot, or if you are not using one of those two functions.

   By default, this function does not draw the plot or advance the frame. Set the resources gsnDraw and/or gsnFrame to True
   if you need this.

   The special resources gsnZonalMeanXMaxF and gsnZonalMeanXMinF allow the user to change the X-axis of the zonal average
   plot. gsnZonalMeanYRefLine sets the value that the reference line will be drawn at on the zonal average plot (default
   value = 0).

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   To change which edge to attach the zonal means plot, you can set amSide (the default is "left"). To move the zonal plot
   away from or closer to the map plot, use amOrthogonalPosF.

Examples

   For an example of what a zonal means plot looks like, see:
     * "zonal_3.ncl" (view example)
       This plot was generated using the gsnZonalMean resource.

   Here's an example of creating a zonal means plot without using gsnZonalMean:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

begin
;
; variable and file handling
;
  in  = addfile("83.nc","r")
  ts = in->TS(0,:,:)                            ; select variable to ave
;
; plotting
;
  wks  = gsn_open_wks("x11","zonal")            ; Opens a ps file

  res                 = True                    ; make plot mods
  res@tiMainString    = "Zonal Average"         ; Title for the plot

  zres@vpWidthF             = 0.13    ; Make plot less wide than default.
  zres@amOrthogonalPosF     = 0.09    ; Move zonal plot away from map a little.

  res@gsnFrame             = False              ; don't draw yet
  res@gsnDraw              = False              ; don't advance frame

  plot = gsn_csm_contour_map_ce(wks,ts,res)     ; plot temp contours

  zres                      = True

  zres@gsnDraw              = True
  zres@gsnFrame             = True

  zres@gsnZonalMeanXMinF    = 240      ; min X-axis value for zonal mean plot
  zres@gsnZonalMeanXMaxF    = 315      ; max X-axis value for zonal mean plot
  zres@gsnZonalMeanYRefLine = 273.15   ; X-axis reference line value

  zonal_id = gsn_csm_attach_zonal_means(wks,plot,ts,zres)
end
