Arguments

   x

   The variable array to be used. Must be type float or double.
   diro

   Directory where output graphics will be placed.
   caseName

   Unique identifier which will be placed on plot. Typically, the is the CAM case identifier. Spaces not allowed because it
   is used as part of the output file name.
   varName

   Name of the variable to be processed. See "Description" section below.
   latBound

   Latitude boundary. If this is a scalar, The southern latitude boundary will automatically set to -latBound. If it is a
   one-dimensional array of length 2, then latBound(0) with be the southern boundary and latBound(1) with be the northern
   boundary,
   spd

   Sampling rate ("samples per day") on the input file(s). Typically, spd is one of the following [1,2,4,8,12,24]. These
   correspond to [24,12,6,3,2,1] hour sampling rates.
   nDayWin

   Length of the temporal window in days. Typically, for Wheeler-Kiladis space-time spectra, nDayWin=96.
   nDaySkip

   Number of days to skip between temporal windows. A negative value means that overlapping windows will be used. For
   example, if nDayWin=96 and nDaySkip=-65, then the last 65 days of the previous temporal window will be included in the
   current temporal window.
   opt

   If opt=False, the function will operate under default mode regardless of any attributes associated with the variable.

   If opt=True, then attributes associated with opt may be used to alter the default behavior.

          opt@debug=True: Multiple printVarSummary will be activated. Default: opt@debug=False.

          opt@pltType - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will specify the output format of the
          plots. Allowed formats are "ps", "eps", "x11", "ncgm". Default: "ps"

          opt@pltTitle - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will specify the main title to be
          placed at the top of each figure. If opt@pltTitle="" or " ", no title will be placed on the plot. Default is:

        pltTitle = caseName+" "+varName+" LOG[Power: "+latBound+"S-"+latBound+"N]"

          opt@pltColorMap - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will specify color map to be
          used. Currently, the color map amwg_blueyellowred is the default.

          opt@cnLinesOn - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will specify if contour lines are
          to be plotted. If, opt@cnLinesOn=False, then no contour lines will be drawn. Default: opt@cnLinesOn=True

          opt@Fig_1 - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will explicitly specify the contour
          levels to be used for "Figure 1" of the Wheeler-Kiladis paper. It is recommended that 15 contour levels be
          specified. EG:

        opt@Fig_1 = fspan(-3.3, 0.9, 15)                          ; equal spacing
        or
        opt@Fig_1 = (/-18.2,-18.0,-17.8,-17.6,-17.5,-17.4,-17.3 \ ; unequal
                     ,-17.2,-17.1,-17.0,-16.9,-16.8,-16.7,-16.6 \
                     ,-16.5/)

          opt@Fig_2 - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will explicitly specify the contour
          levels to be used for "Figure 2" of the Wheeler-Kiladis paper. This is the "background" spectrum.

          opt@Fig_3a - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will explicitly specify the contour
          levels to be used for "Figure 3a" of the Wheeler-Kiladis paper. This is the ratio of the (asymmetric/background).

          opt@Fig_3b - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute will explicitly specify the contour
          levels to be used for "Figure 3b" of the Wheeler-Kiladis paper. This is the ratio of the (symmetric/background).

          opt@spdSkip - If opt=True and this attribute is present, then this attribute specifes the number of temporal
          samples to to be skipped on input. The default is opt@spdSkip=1 which means all the data are read from the files.
          If, say, opt@spdSkip=2, then every other temporal sample will be read. Hence, this attribute decimates the
          sampling rate. EG: spd=4 (6 hour sampling rate) and opt@spdSkip=2, then the effective sampling rate will be
          reduced to 2 samples per day. This could be useful if memory is limited.

          opt@netCDF - If opt=True and this attribute is present and is set to True (ie: opt@netCDF=True), a netCDF file
          containing the Fig_1 variables will be created. By default, the file will be written to the 'current' directory
          with the file name SpaceTime.varName.nc. The user may alter this behavior by setting the options dirNetCDF and
          filNetCDF. The former specifies the directory to which the netCDF file will be written; the latter specifies the
          name of the netCDF file.

Description

   This procedure will create plots similar to Wheeler and Kiladis figures 1-3.

   For historical reasons, this procedure has contour levels 'hard-wired' for specific variable names [varName]: "FLUT",
   "OLR", "olr", "U200", "U850", "OMEGA500" and "PRECT". The contour resource, cnLevels, is used. If the user wishes to
   override these contour intervals or, if the varName is not one of the hard-wired variables, the user may specify the
   contour levels to be used via the appropriate opt attributes. Otherwise, NCL will automatically choose contour levels.
