linint2_Wrap

   Interpolates from a rectilinear grid to another rectilinear grid using bilinear interpolation, and retains metadata.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function linint2_Wrap (
                xi            : numeric,
                yi            : numeric,
                fi            : numeric,
                fiCyclicX [1] : logical,
                xo        [*] : numeric,
                yo        [*] : numeric,
                foOption  [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   xi

   An array that specifies the X coordinates of the fi array. Most frequently, this is a 1D monotonically increasing array
   that may be unequally spaced. In some cases, xi can be a multi-dimensional array (see next paragraph). The rightmost
   dimension (call it nxi) must have at least two elements, and is the last (fastest varying) dimension of fi.

   If xi is a multi-dimensional array, then each nxi subsection of xi must be monotonically increasing, but may be unequally
   spaced. All but its rightmost dimension must be the same size as all but fi's rightmost two dimensions.

   For geo-referenced data, xi is generally the longitude array.
   yi

   An array that specifies the Y coordinates of the fi array. Most frequently, this is a 1D monotonically increasing array
   that may be unequally spaced. In some cases, yi can be a multi-dimensional array (see next paragraph). The rightmost
   dimension (call it nyi) must have at least two elements, and is the second-to-last dimension of fi.

   If yi is a multi-dimensional array, then each nyi subsection of yi must be monotonically increasing, but may be unequally
   spaced. All but its rightmost dimension must be the same size as all but fi's rightmost two dimensions.

   For geo-referenced data, yi is generally the latitude array.
   fi

   An array of two or more dimensions. The two rightmost dimensions must of size nyi x nxi, and are the dimensions used in
   the interpolation. If missing values are present, the attribute fi@_FillValue must be set appropriately.
   fiCyclicX

   An option to indicate whether the rightmost dimension of fi is cyclic. This should be set to True only if you have global
   data, but your longitude values don't quite wrap all the way around the globe. For example, if your longitude values go
   from, say, -179.75 to 179.75, or 0.5 to 359.5, then you would set this to True.
   xo

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the X coordinates of the return array. It must be monotonically increasing, but
   may be unequally spaced.

   For geo-referenced data, xo is generally the longitude array.
   yo

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the Y coordinates of the return array. It must be monotonically increasing, but
   may be unequally spaced.

   For geo-referenced data, yo is generally the latitude array.
   foOption

   Reserved for future use. Currently not used, but set it to 0.

Return value

   The returned value will have the same dimensions as fi, except for the rightmost two dimensions which will have the same
   dimension sizes as the lengths of yo and xo. The return type will be double if fi is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   linint2_Wrap uses bilinear interpolation to interpolate from one rectilinear grid to another. The input grid may be
   cyclic in the x direction. The interpolation is first performed in the x direction, and then in the y direction.

   If missing values are present, then linint2_Wrap will perform the bilinear interpolation at all points possible, but will
   return missing values at coordinates which could not be used.

   If the output coordinates (xo,yo) are outside those of the input coordinates (xi,yi), then the fo values at those
   coordinates will be set to missing (i.e. no extrapolation is performed).

   linint2_Wrap differs from linint2_points_Wrap in that the former is designed to interpolate from grid-to-grid, while the
   latter is designed to interpolate from a grid to specified locations.

   This function is identical to the built-in function linint2, except it retains metadata.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume fi is dimensioned niy x nix (30 x 80), and that the rightmost dimension is not to be treated as cyclic. The
   returned array will be of size noy x nox, where noy and nox are the sizes of the one-dimensional arrays xo and yo:
  xi = (30,33,35,39,....., 80)     [does not have to be equally spaced]
  yi = (0,1,2,3,....,28,29)

  xo = (any coordinates between 30 and 80)  [inclusive]
  yo = (any coordinates between 0 and 29)  [inclusive]

  fo = linint2_Wrap (xi,yi,fi, False, xo,yo, 0)

   Example 2

   Assume fi is a 4D array dimensioned ntim x nlvl x nlat x mlon (ntim=50, nlvl=30, nlat=64, mlon=128), and that the
   rightmost dimension is to be treated as cyclic (the user should not add a cyclic point for the rightmost dimension).

   All times and levels will be interpolated and returned in a new array fo dimensioned ntim x nlvl x 73 x 144:
  lon = (0., 2.8125, .... , 357,0125)
  lat = (-87.8638, ... ,87.8638)

  LON = (0., 2.5, ... , 357.5)    ; length 144
  LAT = (-90.,87.5,...90.)        ; length 73

  fo = linint2_Wrap (lon,lat,fi, True, LON,LAT, 0)
