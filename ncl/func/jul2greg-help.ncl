jul2greg

   Converts the astronomical Julian day given a Gregorian date.

Prototype

        function jul2greg (
                julian  : double or integer
        )

        return_val [see return section] :  integer

Arguments

   julian

   A mult-dimensional double or integer array. The array type determines the form of the return value. See the return value
   section for details.

Return value

   The structure of the return value is dependent upon the type of julian. If julian is a double, then a dimsizes (julian) x
   4 array is returned where element 0 is the year, 1 is the month, 2 is the day, and 3 is the hour. If julian is an
   integer, then a dimsizes(julian) x 3 array is returned, where element 0 is the year, 1 is the month, and 2 is the day.
   The type is integer in both cases.

Description

   Converts an astronomical Julian day to a Gregorian date. The astronomical Julian day is defined as the number of days
   since January 1, 4713 B.C. A Julian day begins at noon Universal Time [UT: 12Z] of the given date (Fliegel & Van
   Flandern, (1968), A Machine Algorithm for Processing Calendar Dates, Communications of the ACM 11 No. 10, p657)

   Due to the size of Julian day number, various variants of the astronomical Julian Day calendar have been introduced.
   Generally, these are offsets to the astronomical Julian Day calendar. Please read the description and rationales here.

   In V6.1.0. this function was upgraded to recognize missing values.

Examples

   Example 1

 i = jul2greg(2415020 )   ; ==> i(0)=1899, i(1)=12, i(2)=31

 j = jul2greg(2415020.5)  ; ==> j(0)=1900, j(1)=1, j(2)=1, j(3)=0
 j = jul2greg(2415020.75) ; ==> j(0)=1900, j(1)=1, j(2)=1, j(3)=6
 j = jul2greg(2415021.  ) ; ==> j(0)=1900, j(1)=1, j(2)=1, j(3)=12
 j = jul2greg(2415021.25) ; ==> j(0)=1900, j(1)=1, j(2)=1, j(3)=18

 year  = (/1950,1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2500/)
 month = (/   1,   1,   1,   7,   1,   1,  12/)
 day   = (/   1,   1,   1,  15,   1,   1,  31/)
 hour  = (/  -1,  -1,  -1,  -1,  -1,  -1,  -1/)

 ymd = jul2greg(julim)
