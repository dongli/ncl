chartolong

   Coerces values of type character to values of NCL type long (deprecated; use tolong).

Prototype

        function chartolong (
                char_val  : character
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(char_val)] :  long

Arguments

   char_val

   A character variable of any dimension.

Return value

   The returned value has the same dimensionality as the input variable char_val.

Description

   This function converts an ASCII character (or characters) to its decimal equivalent and returns that as an NCL long. For
   example, conversion of the ASCII character 'a' yields the value 97 as an NCL long.

   Note: this function and other xxxtolong functions have been superceded by tolong.

   This function performs coercion that is not automatically available through the NCL grammar. See the section on coercion
   of types for details on NCL's automatic type conversions.

   This function is an alias for the function charactertolong. It is identical to that function and is included just for
   people who don't like to type (or like the shorter names).

   Attributes, with the exception of _FillValue, are not propagated by the conversion functions. See Example 2 below.

   Special considerations apply to how missing values are handled in the conversion functions. See Example 2.

Examples

   Example 1

   Convert an ASCII 'A' to its decimal equivalent expressed as an NCL long value.
begin
  ch = integertocharacter (65)
  print(ch)                    ; Prints the ASCII character A.
  db = chartolong(ch)
  print (db)                   ; Prints long precision 65.
end

   Example 2

   Shows how missing values are handled.

begin
;
;  Conversion does not preserve attributes, except missing value.
;  A character missing value is converted to its ASCII equivalent
;  and that converted to a long when a character missing value
;  is propagated to a long variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(68)/)
  a@T = "string"
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = chartolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has no missing value
;  specified and the original variable does, the missing
;  value of the target variable inherits the missing value of the
;  original variable and the missing values
;  of the original variable are retained in
;  the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(65)/)
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = chartolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has a missing
;  value specified and the original variable
;  has a missing value specified, the missing
;  value of the target variable is retained
;  even when the missing value of the original
;  variable is in the range of the type of the
;  target variable.  Missing values in the
;  original variable are converted to the
;  missing value of the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(65)/)
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = new(3,long,80)
  b = chartolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
end
