gsn_csm_streamline

   Creates and draws a streamline plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_streamline (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                u [*][*] : numeric,
                v [*][*] : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the streamline plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the streamline plot created is returned. The id of the data object is also returned as an attribute called
   data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a streamline plot on the given workstation.

   If either u or v have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   In NCL V6.1.0, this function was updated to automatically create a labeblar if stMonoLineColor is set to False.
