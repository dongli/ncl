wgt_volave

   Calculates the volume average of a quantity using weights.

Prototype

        function wgt_volave (
                q        : numeric,
                wgtz [*] : numeric,
                wgty [*] : numeric,
                wgtx [*] : numeric,
                opt      : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   q

   An array of 3 or more dimensions containing the data to be averaged. The rightmost dimensions should correspond to
   "level" (lev), "latitude" (lat), and "longitude" (lon) when dealing with quantities on a sphere ([...,],lev,lat,lon), and
   "z", "y", and "x" otherwise ([...,],z,y,x).
   wgtz

   A scalar (typically 1.0) or 1-dimensional array of size "level" (z) containing the weights.
   wgty

   A scalar (typically 1.0) or 1-dimensional array of size "lat" (y) containing the weights.
   wgtx

   A scalar (typically 1.0) or 1-dimensional array of size "lon" (x) containing the weights.
   opt

   If opt = 0, the area average is calculated using available non-missing data. If opt = 1, then if any point in q is
   missing, the area average is not computed. In this case, it will be set to the missing value, which is indicated by
   q@_FillValue, or the default missing value if q@_FillValue is not set.

Return value

   Returns a scalar if q is a two dimensional array. Otherwise, the output dimensionality is the same as the leftmost
   dimensions of the input q.

   The return type is floating point if the input is floating point, and double if the input is of type double.

Description

   This function computes a volume average of a quantity using weights. It ignores missing values (q@_FillValue).

Examples

   Example 1

   Let q(time, lev, lat, lon) be a global array with dimension sizes ktime = 120, nlev = 28, nlat = 64, mlon = 128 and
   wgtz(klev) be a 1-dimensional array containing the log of pressure or "delta-pressures" and wgty(nlat) be a 1-dimensional
   array containing gaussian or cosine weights. Assume that no special weighting is applied in the longitude (x) direction.
   Then:
   glAve = wgt_volave(q, wgtz, wgty, 1.0, 0)   ; glAve(ktime)

   will calculate the volume (global) average for each time. glAve will be a 1-dimensional array with dimension (ktime =
   120). If a missing value is encountered at any of the rightmost dimension, then the result will be set to q@_FillValue
   (opt = 0).

   Example 2

   nhAve = wgt_volave (q(:, :, 33:nlat - 1, :), wgtz, wgty(33:nlat), 1.0, 1)

   will calculate the volume (northern hemisphere) average for each time and level. Standard subscripting is used to subset
   the input global array. nlAve will be a 1-dimensional array with dimension (ktime = 120). If a missing value is
   encountered at any of the rightmost dimension, it is ignored (equivalent to a weight of 0.0) and the average is
   calculated using available non-missing data (opt = 1).

   Example 3

   shAve = wgt_volave(q(:, 5:7, {lat | -90:0}, :), wgtz(5:7), wgty({lat | -90:0}), 1.0,0)

   will calculate the volume (southern hemisphere) average for each time using levels = 5, 6, 7. Named subscripting and
   standard subscripting are used to subset the input global array. shAve will have dimension (ktime).
