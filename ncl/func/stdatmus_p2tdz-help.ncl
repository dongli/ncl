stdatmus_p2tdz

   Calculates the corresponding temperature, density, and height based on the 1976 U.S. standard atmosphere, given the
   pressure.

Prototype

        function stdatmus_p2tdz (
                p  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  [3,[,...]]

Arguments

   p

   A scalar or multi-dimensional array specifying the pressure values (hPa [mb]).

Return value

   If p is a scalar, then a one-dimensional array of length 3 will be returned. Element (0) will contain the temperature
   [C]; (1) will contain the density [kg/m^3] and (2) will contain height [m]. If p is an array, then an array of the same
   size as p plus an additional leftmost dimension of length 3 is returned. The three elements are the same as just
   described. The type will be double if p is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   This function uses the software provided by NCAR's Data Support Section to compute temperature, density and height based
   on the 1976 U.S. standard atmosphere given height values. See the DSS's meteorological calculations link.

   NOTE: Values not valid above 84852 meters.

Examples

   Example 1

   p   = 1001.29
   tdz = stdatmus_p2tdz(p)    ; ===> tdz(3) = (/ 14.35, 1.21328, 100. /)

   Example 2

   p   = (/1013, 1000, 750, 500, 100,  10, 1 /)
   tdz = stdatmus_p2tdz(p)    ; ===> tdz(3,6)
