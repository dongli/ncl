mixhum_ptd

   Calculates the mixing ratio or specific humidity given pressure and dew point temperature.

Prototype

        function mixhum_ptd (
                p         : numeric,
                tdk       : numeric,
                iswit [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(p)] :  numeric

Arguments

   p

   An array of any dimensionality equal to pressure in Pa.
   tdk

   An array of any dimensionality equal to temperature dew point in K. Must be the same size as p.
   iswit

   An integer scalar that determines which variable is returned. 1 = mixing ratio (kg/kg), 2 = specific humidity (kg/kg). A
   negative value changes the units to g/kg.

Return value

   An array of same size as p. The values will be the mixing ratio or the specific humidity depending upon the value of
   iswit.

Description

   Calculates the mixing ratio or specific humidity given pressure and dew point temperature. Missing values are allowed but
   ignored.

Examples

   Example 1

   Wallace and Hobbs [Atmospheric Science: An introductory Survey, Academic Press (p74)] state that at p=100000 [Pa] and
   td=6.4 [C] the mixing ratio is approximately 6 [g/kg]:
  p  = 100000          ; Pa
  tdk=  6.4 + 273.15   ; K

  w = mixhum_ptd (p, tdk, 1)     ; ==> 0.006061566 (kg/kg)

   Example 2

   Let p be in hPa. It must be converted.
  w    = mixhum_ptd (p*100., tdk, -1 ) ; ==> 6.06 (g/kg)
