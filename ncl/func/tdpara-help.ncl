tdpara

   Defines the reference parallelogram for use with selected TDPACK routines.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdpara (
                uvw00 [3] : float,
                uvw10 [3] : float,
                uvw01 [3] : float
        )

Arguments

   uvw00

   A float array of 3 elements defining the position of the "origin" of the parallelogram: the point with parallelogram
   coordinates (0,0).
   uvw10

   A float array of 3 elements defining the U, V, and W components of the vector from the origin of the parallelogram to the
   point with parallelogram coordinates (1,0).
   uvw01

   A float array of 3 elements defining the U, V, and W components of the vector from the origin of the parallelogram to the
   point with parallelogram coordinates (0,1).

Description

   This initialization routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines
   for projecting objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane
   having X and Y axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as
   "drawing objects in three dimensions".

   This routine may be thought of as an initialization routine or as just a routine to access certain internal values; it
   simply transfers the values of its arguments into TDPACK labelled common blocks for later use by other TDPACK routines.

   Please see the documentation on TDPARA for a full description of this procedure.
