isfunc

   Returns True for every element of the input that is a defined function.

Prototype

        function isfunc (
                func_names  : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(func_names)] :  logical

Arguments

   func_names

   An array of strings of any dimensionality.

Description

   For each element in the func_names list, isfunc returns True if it is the name of a defined function, and False if the
   function doesn't exist or is a procedure.

   Note that this function works on both built-in functions as well as functions written in NCL.

Examples

   Example 1

  print(isfunc("sin"))       ; True
  print(isfunc("print"))     ; False because "print" is a procedure
  print(isfunc("lalala"))    ; False because "lalala" doesn't exist

   Example 2

   This example tests for existing functions that may be part of an NCL script:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclex/gsun/gsn_code.ncl"
...
  print(isfunc("gsn_open_wks"))      ; True, defined in gsn_code.ncl
  print(isfunc("gsn_panel"))         ; False because "gsn_panel" is a procedure
  print(isfunc("gsn_csm_contour"))   ; False because "gsn_csm_contour"
                                     ; doesn't exist (it's in gsn_csm.ncl)
