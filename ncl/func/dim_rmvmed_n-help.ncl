dim_rmvmed_n

   Calculates and removes the median of the given dimension(s) at all other dimensions.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function dim_rmvmed_n (
                x        : numeric,
                dims [*] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   dims

   The dimension(s) of x on which to calculate and remove the median. Must be consecutive and monotonically increasing.

Return value

   The output is of type double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

   The dimensionality is the same as the input dimensionality.

Description

   The dim_rmvmed_n function calculates and removes the median from all elements of the dimensions indicated by dims for
   each index of the remaining dimensions. Missing values are ignored. Use dim_rmvmed_n_Wrap if retention of metadata is
   desired.

Examples

   Example 1:

   Let x be a 1-dimensional array: (a) Create a new variable, xNew, that contains just the deviations from the median; (b)
   replace the variable x with the deviations.
  xNew = dim_rmvmed_n(x,0)     ; new variable
  x    = dim_rmvmed_n(x,0)     ; overwrite with deviations

   Note: when operating across the rightmost dimension, it is simpler to use dim_rmvmed.

   Example 2:

   Let x be a 3-dimensional array with dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). To remove the medians of the "nlon" dimension:
   xRmvLon = dim_rmvmed_n (x,2)       ; new variable containing deviations (no metadata)
   x       = dim_rmvmed_n (x,2)       ; overwrite with deviations from median

   Example 3:

   Let x be a 3-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). To remove
   the median of the time dimension from all lat/lon indices:
   xRmvTime = dim_rmvmed_n(x,0)
   xRmvTime = dim_rmvmed_n_Wrap(x,0) ; retain metadata

   Example 4:

   Let x be a 4-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lev, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlev, nlat, nlon).
   To remove the median of the time/lev dimensions from all lat/lon indices:
   xRmv = dim_rmvmed_n(x,(/0,1/))
   xRmv = dim_rmvmed_n_Wrap(x,(/0,1/)) ; retain metadata

   Example 5:

   Let x be as in Example 3 and let x contain monthly medians for (say) 10 years of data (ntim=120). Monthly anomalies for
   each month could be calculated using array subscripting.
   xRmvJan  = dim_rmvmed_n(x(0:ntim-1:12,:,:),0)
   xRmvJuly = dim_rmvmed_n(x(6:ntim-1:12,:,:),0)
