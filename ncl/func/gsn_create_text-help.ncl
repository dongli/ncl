gsn_create_text

   Creates text strings.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_create_text (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                text    : integer,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val  :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   text

   The array of text strings you want to create.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of text resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   Ids of the text strings created are returned. This is useful if you want to use gsn_add_annotation to attach the strings
   to a plot.

Description

   This function creates graphical representations of text strings, given an array of text strings. Note that this function
   does not draw the strings. To do this, you must call draw and pass it the text ids created.

   This function is similar to the procedure gsn_text_ndc, except it returns the text id(s).
