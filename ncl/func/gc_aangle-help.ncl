gc_aangle

   Finds the acute angle between two great circles on the globe.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function gc_aangle (
                lat  : numeric,
                lon  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   lat
   lon

   Latitudes and longitudes, in degrees, of vertices. The first two pairs of lat/lon values specify vertices of an arc of
   one great circle and the second two pairs specify the vertices of the second circle. These can be multi-dimensional
   arrays, but the rightmost dimension size must be 4 for specifying the vertices of the two arcs. If lat and lon have more
   than one dimension, then they must agree in number of dimensions and dimension sizes.

Return value

   The acute angle, in degrees, between the great circles defined by the arcs as describe above. This will be a non-negative
   value. If the input arrays are singly dimensioned, then the return value will be a scalar. If the input arrays are
   multi-dimensional, then the returned array will have one less dimension than the number of dimensions of the input arrays
   and the dimension sizes of the returned array will agree with those of the input arrays up through their penultimate
   dimension. The return value will be of type double if either of the input arguments is of type double and type float
   otherwise.

Description

   This function finds the acute angle between two great circles, given two pairs of points on the globe that define two
   arcs.

   Missing values are not honored as such, since it does not make sense to have a vertex specified as a missing value.
