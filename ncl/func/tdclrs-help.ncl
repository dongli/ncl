tdclrs

   Defines a set of colors for use with selected TDPACK routines.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdclrs (
                wks             [1] : graphic,
                color_scheme    [1] : integer,
                shade_intensity [1] : float,
                shade_range     [1] : float,
                color_index1    [1] : integer,
                color_index2    [1] : integer,
                nblocks         [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier for where you want to draw the surface. The wks identifier is one returned either from
   calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   color_scheme

   An integer scalar specifying the basic color scheme (white on black or black on white). If color_scheme is 0, the
   foreground color is white and the background color is black; if color_scheme is non-zero, the opposite is true.
   shade_intensity
   shade_range

   Scalar values between 0 and 1, inclusive, specifying how color shades are to be generated. shade_intensity values of near
   0 call for more intense shades to be used, while values near 1 call for more nearly pastel shades to be used. shade_range
   values near 0 say that a narrower range of shades is to be used, while values near 1 say that a broader range of shades
   is to be used.
   color_index1
   color_index2

   Integer scalars specifying the first and last integers in a block of color indices to be used for N shades of gray
   ranging from pure white to pure black (where N=color_index1-color_index2+1).

   The next N indices (in numerical order) will be used for the shades of gray selected by color_intensity and color_range;
   the next N indices after that for selected shades of red, the next N indices after that for selected shades of green, and
   so on.
   nblocks

   A scalar integer value, that if set to between 1 and 7, inclusive, says that only that many blocks of N indices will be
   defined.

   For example, if nblocks has the value 4, only the black-to-white scale and the shades of gray, red, and green will be
   generated; shades of blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow will not be. (This allows one to have more shades of each color at
   the expense of using fewer colors.) Using a value of nblocks less than 1 or greater than 7 will result in all 8*N sets of
   color shades being defined.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDCLRS for a full description of this procedure.
