dim_rmvmean_n

   Calculates and removes the mean of the given dimension(s) at all other dimensions.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function dim_rmvmean_n (
                x        : numeric,
                dims [*] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   dims

   The dimension(s) of x on which to calculate and remove the mean. Must be consecutive and monotonically increasing.

Return value

   The output is of type double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

   The dimensionality is the same as the input dimensionality.

Description

   The dim_rmvmean_n function calculates and removes the mean from all elements of the dimensions indicated by dims for each
   index of the remaining dimensions. Missing values are ignored.

   Use dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1:

   Let x be a 1-dimensional array: (a) Create a new variable, xNew, that contains just the deviations from the mean; (b)
   replace the variable x with the deviations.
  xNew = dim_rmvmean_n(x,0)      ; new variable
  x    = dim_rmvmean_n(x,0)      ; overwrite with deviations

   Note: when operating across the rightmost dimension, it is simpler to use dim_rmvmean.

   Example 2:

   Let x be a 3-dimensional array with dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). To remove the means of the "nlon" dimension:
   xRmvLon = dim_rmvmean_n (x,2)       ; new variable containing deviations (no metadata)
   xRmvLon = dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap(x, 2)    ; with metadata
   x       = dim_rmvmean_n (x,2)       ; overwrite with deviations

   Example 3:

   Let x be a 3-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). To remove
   the mean of the time dimension from all lat/lon indices:
   xRmvTime = dim_rmvmean_n(x,0)
   xRmvTime = dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap(x,0)

   Example 4:

   Let x be a 4-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lev, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlev, nlat, nlon).
   To remove the mean of the time/level dimensions from all lat/lon indices:
   xRmv = dim_rmvmean_n(x,(/0,1/))
   xRmv = dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap(x,(/0,1/))

   Example 5:

   Let x be as in Example 3 and let x contain monthly means for (say) 10 years of data (ntim=120). Monthly anomalies for
   each month could be calculated using array subscripting.
   xRmvJan  = dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap(x(0:ntim-1:12,:,:),0)
   xRmvJuly = dim_rmvmean_n_Wrap(x(6:ntim-1:12,:,:),0)
