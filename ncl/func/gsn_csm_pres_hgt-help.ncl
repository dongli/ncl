gsn_csm_pres_hgt

   Creates and draws a pressure/height plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_pres_hgt (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   data

   The two-dimensional data to contour. The leftmost dimension must contain a one-dimensional coordinate array of pressure
   values, and the values must be in the correct units. This is determined by examining the "units" attribute of the
   coordinate variable. Some accepted units are "hpa", "hPa", "Pa", "pa", "mb", "millibars", etc. If the units attribute
   doesn't exist or has the wrong value, an error will be issued.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the contour plot created is returned. The id of the data object is also returned as an attribute called
   data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a pressure/height versus latitude, longitude, or time plot on the given workstation.

   The left Y-axis will be labeled with reverse log pressure values, and the right Y-axis with height values in km. The
   height values are a logarithmic interpolation from Standard Atmosphere of the pressure array. The pressure coordinate
   array values must lie between 1013.25 mb and 0.010 mb.

   If data has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   If the resource cnFillOn is set to True, then the following will happen automatically:
     * a labelbar will be automatically added (default horizontal)
     * contour line labels will be turned off
     * the contour information label will be turned off

   If you want to turn the labelbar off, set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to False so that no cyclic point will be added to the data.

   If data has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this
   attribute is used for the left string title.

   If data has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
