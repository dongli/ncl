g2gshv

   Interpolates a vector quantity from one Gaussian to another (optional truncation).

Prototype

        procedure g2gshv (
                ua        : numeric,
                va        : numeric,
                ub        : float,    ; or double
                vb        : float,    ; or double
                twave [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   ua
   va

   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. The values must be in
   ascending latitude order.
   ub
   vb

   (output)
   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. Values will be in
   ascending latitude order. All but the two rightmost dimensions must be the same as all but the two rightmost dimensions
   of ua and va.

   Since g2gshv is a procedure, the user must explicitly preallocate memory for these return arrays.
   twave

   Scalar integer indicating the optional wave truncation:
   twave = 0 => exact interpolation
       twave > 0 => exact interpolation and triangular truncation at twave
       twave < 0 => exact interpolation, triangular truncation at twave and spectral coefficient tapering (the effect is to
       smooth the data)

Description

   g2gshv interpolates a vector pair from one Gaussian grid (ua,va) to another (ub,vb) (optional truncation) using spherical
   harmonics (via the Spherepack code). Values will be in ascending latitude order.

   Arrays which have dimensions [...] x nlata x nlona should not include the cyclic (wrap-around) points when invoking this
   procedure. For example, if arrays u and v have dimensions nlata = 64 and nlona = 129, where the "129" represents the
   cyclic point, then the user should pass the data to g2gshv via:
  z = g2gshv(u(...,0:nlona-2), v(...,0:nlona-2),...)  ; does not include cyclic points

   This procedure can only be used on grids that span the globe. It cannot be used for limited area grids.

   Please read the caveats that you should be aware of when using spherical harmonic regridding.

   Use g2gshv_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume u and v are dimensioned nt x nlat x nlon, and that they are of type float or double.

   The code below interpolates from a Gaussian T63 grid (nlat=94, nlon=192) to a Gaussian T42 grid (jlat=64,ilon=128) with
   triangular truncation at wave 42:
  uNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(u) )
  vNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(v) )

  g2gshv (u,v, uNew,vNew, 42)

Errors

   ier is equal to:

     4 or 10 if nlona (ilon) is less than 4
     5 or 10 if nlata (jlat) is less than 3
     8 if nlonb is less than 4
     9 if nlatb is less than 3
