gsn_csm_x2y2

   Creates and draws an XY plot with two different X and Y axes

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_x2y2 (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                x1       : numeric,
                x2       : numeric,
                y1       : numeric,
                y2       : numeric,
                res1 [1] : logical,
                res2 [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   x1
   x2

   The X coordinates corresponding to the Y curves. The x1/y1 curve will be represented on the left/bottom axes, and the
   x2/y2 curve will be represented on the right/top axes.
   y1
   y2

   The Y coordinates of each curve.
   res1

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources for the first curve, attached as attributes. Set to True if you
   want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want
   the resources applied.

   Note that for setting resources that don't particularly apply to a specific plot, like frame maximization (gsnMaximize),
   a main title (tiMainString), or the three subtitles at the top (gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, gsnRightString), you
   should set these resources with res1, and not res2.
   res2

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources for the second curve, attached as attributes. Set to True if you
   want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want
   the resources applied.

   The res2 resources should only be resources that apply specifically to the x2/y2 data that you are plotting (see example
   below).

Return value

   The return value is the scalar id of the first XY plot created.

   The scalar id of the second XY plot is returned as an attribute called "xy2". This attribute or the return value can be
   used in calls to functions like gsn_add_polymarker or gsn_add_polyline to add primitives to either plot.

   The id of the data object is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change
   some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws an XY plot on the given workstation, with two different X and Y axes represented. By
   default, the tickmarks will point outward. The plot id returned is the one that represents the left Y axis. The right
   axis plot id is returned as an attribute of the return value called "xy2".

   As with a regular XY plot, NCL will try to pick "nice" values for the X and Y axes. This means that your X and Y axes may
   not line up as expected. To control the X/Y axes so that the min/max of each has the min/max of your actual data, set the
   trXMinF, trXMaxF trYMinF, and trYMaxF resources. For example:

  res1@trXMinF = min(x1)
  res1@trXMaxF = max(x1)
  res1@trYMinF = min(y1)
  res1@trYMaxF = max(y1)
  res2@trXMinF = min(x2)
  res2@trXMaxF = max(x2)
  res2@trYMinF = min(y2)
  res2@trYMaxF = max(y2)

   If any of x1, x2, y1, or y2 has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   Note that if x2@long_name is set, this would normally be used to label the X axis. However, since labeling the top axis
   along with the possibility of a main title and/or three subtitles could cause quite a bit of clutter, the long_name
   attribute is ignored in this case. If you want it to appear, set tiXAxisString explicitly:
  res2@tiXAxisString = x2@long_name

   There are other special gsn resources that apply to XY plots. See the gsn resource page for a full list.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
