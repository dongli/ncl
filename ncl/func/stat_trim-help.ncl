stat_trim

   Calculates trimmed estimates of the first two moments of the given input.

Prototype

        procedure stat_trim (
                x         : numeric,
                ptrim [1] : float,    ; or double
                xmeant    : float,    ; or double
                xsdt      : float,    ; or double
                nptused   : integer
        )

Arguments

   x

   An array of any dimensionality. Missing values should be indicated by x@_FillValue. If x@_FillValue is not set, then the
   NCL default missing value will be assumed.
   ptrim

   A scalar indicating the portion of series to be trimmed (0. <= ptrim < 1.). If ptrim = 0, then calculate the whole series
   mean and standard deviation. Otherwise, a minimum of two points will be trimmed.
   xmeant
   xsdt

   (output)
   Variables that will contain the mean and sample standard deviation of trimmed x. The dimensions should be the same as x,
   with the rightmost dimension omitted (or a scalar if x is one-dimensional). Space for these variables must be explicitly
   allocated by the user.
   nptused

   (output)
   Variable that will contain the number of points used. It must have the same dimensionality as xmeant and xsdt, and space
   for it must be explicitly allocated by the user.

Description

   stat_trim calculates trimmed estimates of the first two moments of the rightmost dimension in x containing missing data.

   If ndims represents the number of dimensions in x, then for the leftmost dimensions 0 to ndims-2, the calculations are
   done on the rightmost dimension (ndims-1^th dimension) of the input array.

   This function will be updated in V5.0.0 so that if a subarray of x contains all missing values, stat_trim will return
   missing values in the appropriate locations rather than quitting with a fatal error.

Examples

   Run the following example, and then print out the various variables to see how stat2, stat4, stat_medrng, and stat_trim
   work:

begin
;
; Define a 3 x 2 x 2 array
;
   x = (/(/(/1.,2./),(/3.,4./)/),(/(/5.,6./),(/-999,8./)/),\
         (/(/9.,10./),(/11.,-999/)/)/)
   x@_FillValue = -999

   xmean   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xvar    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xskew   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xkurt   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmed    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmrng   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xrng    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmeant  = new((/3,2/),float)
   xsdt    = new((/3,2/),float)
   npts    = new((/3,2/),integer)

   stat2(x,xmean,xvar,npts)
   print(xmean)
   print(xvar)
   print(npts)

   stat4(x,xmean,xvar,xskew,xkurt,npts)
   print(xmean)
   print(xvar)
   print(xskew)
   print(xkurt)
   print(npts)

   stat_medrng(x,xmed,xmrng,xrng,npts)
   print(xmed)
   print(xmrng)
   print(xrng)
   print(npts)

   stat_trim(x,0.0,xmeant,xsdt,npts)
   print(xmeant)
   print(xsdt)
   print(npts)
end
