cdfbin_p

   Calculates the binomial density of a cumulative distribution function.

Prototype

        function cdfbin_p (
                s   : numeric,
                xn  : numeric,
                pr  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   s

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the number of observed successes (Must be > 0)
   xn

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the number of binomial trials (Must be > 0). Must be the same size as
   s.
   pr

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the the probability of success in each binomial trial [0,1] Must be
   the same size as s.

Return value

   A array of the same size as s. Double if any of the input arguments are double, float otherwise.

Description

   Calculates the binomial density of a cumulative distribution function. The binomial density is the probability of s or
   fewer successes in xn trials each with probability of success pr (input/output range: [0,1]).

   The source code is from source routine "CDFBIN" from DCDFLIB (Double precision Cumulative Distribution Function LIBrary)

Examples

   Example 1

     xn    = 30.0
     pr    = 0.75
     s     = 25.7267

     P = cdfbin_p(s,xn,pr)
     print("P="+P)               ; P = 0.95
