NhlDataToNDC

   Converts data units into normalized device coordinates (NDCs).

Prototype

        procedure NhlDataToNDC (
                plot  [1] : graphic,
                x_in  [*] : float,
                y_in  [*] : float,
                x_out [*] : float,
                y_out [*] : float
        )

Arguments

   plot

   A plot object that can be created by using one of the many gsn plotting functions, or by calling the NCL create language
   construct.
   x_in
   y_in

   One-dimensional arrays of x and y data coordinates. They must be the same length. For map plots, x_in corresponds to
   longitude values, and y_in corresponds to latitude values.
   x_out
   y_out

   (output)
   One-dimensional arrays of the same size as x_in and y_in. These will contain the x and y NDC output values.

Description

   The NhlDataToNDC procedure uses the built-in transformation mapping feature of NCL plot objects to map data coordinates
   into Normalized Device Coordinates (NDCs).

   The NhlDataToNDC procedure maps coordinate pairs from x_in and y_in and places the results in the corresponding elements
   of x_out and y_out respectively. Both x_out and y_out can be the same variables as x_in and y_in.

   When the data coordinates are outside of the data transformation specified in the plot, a missing value is placed in both
   of the corresponding indexes in the output arrays. The missing value chosen is either the x_in missing value, y_in
   missing value, or a system default.

   Note: this procedure is identical to the datatondc procedure, and we encourage the use of datatondc instead (saves having
   to type longer names and capital letters).
