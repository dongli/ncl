NhlGetErrorObjectId

   Returns a reference to the current Error object.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.0.0 and later.

Prototype

        function NhlGetErrorObjectId (
        )

        return_val [1] :  object

Description

   The Error object controls NCL error reporting. This function returns a reference to the error object so the error
   resources may be configured by the user.

Examples

   The following code snippets show how to use the NhlGetErrorObjectId function to change error object resources:

  err = NhlGetErrorObjectId()

  setvalues err
    "errPrint" : "False"
  end setvalues

   This will turn off error message printing (typically not desirable). To set the error severity level for printing:

  setvalues err
    "errLevel" : "Fatal"
  end setvalues

   This will show only errors that are Fatal in nature. Errors of lesser severity (Warning and Info) would not be shown.

   To redirect all error reporting to a file:

  setvalues err
    "errFileName" : "/tmp/myErrors"
  end setvalues

   This will send all errors reported by NCL during execution to the file /tmp/myErrors.
