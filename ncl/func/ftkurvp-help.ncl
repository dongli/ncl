ftkurvp

   Calculates an interpolatory spline under tension through a sequence of points in the plane forming a closed curve.

Prototype

        procedure ftkurvp (
                xi [*] : numeric,
                yi [*] : numeric,
                t  [*] : numeric,
                xo [*] : float,    ; or double
                yo [*] : float     ; or double
        )

Arguments

   xi

   A 1D array of any size (npts) containing the abscissae for the input function.
   yi

   A 1D array containing the npts functional values of the input function - yi(k) is the functional value at xi(k) for
   k=0,npts-1.
   t

   Contains a 1D array of mpts values for the parameter mapping onto the interpolated curve.
   xo

   (output)
   A 1D array containing the X values for the interpolated points. t(k) maps to (xo(k),yo(k)) for k=0,mpts-1.
   yo

   (output)
   A 1D array containing the Y values for the interpolated points. t(k) maps to (xo(k),yo(k)) for k=0,mpts-1.

Description

   ftkurvp is in the Fitgrid package - a package containing 1D and 2D interpolators using cubic splines under tension.

   There are some parameters that can alter the behavior of ftkurvp. These parameters all have reasonable default values.
   However, users may change any of these parameters by invoking ftsetp prior to calling ftkurvp. ftkurvp is called after
   all of the desired values for control parameters have been set.

   The only control parameter that applies to ftkurvp is: sig.

   Given a sequence of distinct input points ( (x(0),y(0)), ... , (x(n-1),y(n-1)), the interpolated curve is parameterized
   by mapping points in the interval [0.,1.] onto the interpolated curve. The resulting curve has a parametric
   representation both of whose components are splines under tension and functions of the polygonal arc length. The value 0.
   is mapped onto (x(0),y(0)) and the value 1. is mapped onto (x(0),y(0)) as well (completing the closed curve).

   The value for the parameter sig specifies the tension factor. Values near zero result in a cubic spline; large values
   (e.g. 50) result in nearly a polygonal line. A typical value is 1. (the default).

   You can extrapolate values with ftkurvp (that is, calculate interpolated values for abscissae outside of the domain of
   the input), but these values are, in general, unreliable.

Examples

begin
  x = (/  3.0,  4.0,  9.0, 16.0, 21.0, 27.0,    \
         34.0, 36.0, 34.0, 26.0, 18.0         /)
  y = (/  2.4,  9.6, 14.4, 12.0,  9.6,  8.4,    \
         13.2, 21.6, 30.0, 37.2, 38.4         /)

  mpts = 201
  u = fspan(0.,1.,mpts)

  xo = new( (/ mpts /), float)
  yo = new( (/ mpts /), float)
  ftkurvp(x, y, u, xo, yo)
end

Errors

          = 1 if the number of input points is less than 2.
          = 2 if adjacent coordinate pairs coincide.
