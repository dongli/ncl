band_pass_latlon_time

   Create band-pass filtered series at each lat/lon grid point.

        function band_pass_latlon_time (
                x [*][*][*] : numeric,
                srate   [1] : numeric,
                bpf     [3] : integer,
                opt     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val  :  array the same size and shape as x

Arguments

   x

   A three dimensional variable array. Nominally: (time,lat,lon).
   srate

   Sampling rate. For example: if srate refers to "samples per day", then, srate is one of the following [1,2,4,8,12,24].
   These correspond to [24,12,6,3,2,1] hour sampling rates. Other common sampling units are "samples per year" and "samples
   per month".
   bpf

   An integer array of length 3. The first two elements contain the band pass start and end times. The last element is the
   number of weights to be used.
   opt

   If opt=False, the function will operate under default mode regardless of any attributes associated with the variable.

   If opt=True, then attributes associated with opt may be used to alter the default behavior.

          opt@detrend=True: Series will be detrened. Default: opt@detrend=False.
          opt@fft=True: An fft will be used to perform the filtering. The fft coefficients will be weighted by the response
          function returned by filwgts_lanczos.

          Default: opt@fft=False.

          If opt@fft=True, then a 10% taper will be applied to the series prior to the fft. Default: opt@taper=0.10

Return value

   The values at each grid point will have had the specified band pass filter applied.

Description

   At each time step, the input time series at each grid point is band-pass filtered using weighted running averages or,
   optionally, via an FFT. If the FFT option is activated, the fft coefficients will be weighted by the response function
   returned by filwgts_lanczos.

   The user must be aware that the appropriate number of filter weights is a direct function of the band pass period. The
   shorter the period, the more weights that will be required to sufficiently resolve the desired period.

   The input array, x, should have sufficient temporal padding' so that the filter will have its desired result over the
   period of interest. For example, if daily mean data, srate=1, are being analyzed and bpf(2)=201, then the input array
   should have bpf(2)/2 days padding before and after the time period of focus.

   FYI: The US-CLIVAR MJO working group:
           http://www.usclivar.org/mjo.php

   has suggested a number of diagnostics for evaluating the MJO ( Madden-Julian Oscillation). See their diagnostics website:
     http://climate.snu.ac.kr/mjo_diagnostics/index.htm

   This inclues the statement: "Intraseasonal (20-100 day) bandpass filtered anomalies are constructed using a 201-point
   Lanczos filter, which has half power points at 20 day and 100 day periods."

   Also,

   "No windowing/tapering or de-trending was applied in the calculation of these spectra, since sensitivity tests indicated
   their application had a negligible impact on the results"

Examples

   The following example focuses on the Madden-Julian Oscillatio [MJO]. However, this function is general purpose and can be
   applied to any spatial time series. It can be used to focus on other periods interest.

   Example 1

   Consider daily "olr". Extract information using the 20-to-100 day band pass period and 201 weights as suggested by the
   WMO CLIVAR Working Group.
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/diagnostics_cam.ncl"


  f     = addfile("...", "r")
  x     = f->OLR                 ; (time,lat,lon) , ntim=1461

  latS  = -20.              ; select region
  latN  =  20.
  lonL  =   0.              ;  GM        ; =60  Indian Ocean
  lonR  = 360.              ;            ; =280 East Pacific

  srate = 1                 ; daily means
  bpf   = (/20,100,201/)    ; MJO ... suggested by MJO WG [WMO]
  opt   = False
                            ; pass in area of interest
  bpass = band_pass_latlon_time (x(:,{latS:latN},{lonL:lonR} \
                                ,srate, bpf, opt)

  printVarSummary( bpass )
  printMinMax( bpass, True)

   The edited output (currently) looks like:
