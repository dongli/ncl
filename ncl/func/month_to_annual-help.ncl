month_to_annual

   Converts monthly values to annual values.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.2.0.a033 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function month_to_annual (
                x       : numeric,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   x

   An array containing monthly values. The "time" dimension must be the leftmost dimension if there are multiple dimensions.
   Ideally, the size of the "time" dimension is evenly divisable by 12.
   opt

   option
      opt=0 compute the unweighted sum of 12 values.
      opt=1 divide the unweighted sum by 12 to get the annual mean value(s)..

Return value

   Returns an array with the "time" dimension is decimated by a factor of 12. If any month is missing (_FillValue) for an
   individual year a missing value is returned.

Description

   Typical usage is that an array of monthly precipitation totals (eg, mm) or monthly mean temperatures are input. For
   precipitation, generally opt=0, and the sum of the 12 values is returned. For temperature, generally opt=1, and the
   (unweighted) annual average is returned. All months must be present for an annual vale to be computed; else, an
   _FillValue for that year.

Examples

   Example 1

   A one dimensional array of monthly precipitation totals [mm] is to be converted to annual total. If prc(time) and the
   size of time is 240 monthly values then 20 (=240/12) values (years) will be returned.
        prc_annual_total = month_to_annual(prc, 0)  ; prc_annual_total(20)

   If the array contains, say, monthly mean temperatures (tmp), then
        tmp_annual_mean = month_to_annual(tmp, 1)   ; tmp_annual_mean(20)

   Example 2

   A multi-dimensional array of monthly precipitation totals [mm] is to be converted to annual total. If prc(time,lat,lon)
   and the size of time is 1200 monthly values then 100 (=120/12) values (years) will be returned.
        PRC = month_to_annual(prc, 0)  ; PRC(100,nlat,mlon)

   If the array contains, say, monthly mean temperatures [tmp(time,lev,lat,lon)], then
        TMP = month_to_annual(tmp, 1)  ; TMP(100,klev,nlat,mlon))
