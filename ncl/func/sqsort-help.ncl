sqsort

   Sorts a singly dimensioned arrays of strings.

Prototype

        procedure sqsort (
                value [*] : string
        )

Arguments

   value

   A singly dimensioned array of two or more string values to be sorted.

Description

   This procedure sorts its input array in ascending order. If the input array contains a coordinate variable, then the
   values of the coordinate variable are repositioned relative to their corresponding array value. Missing values are sorted
   to either end of the array based on their actual value (ignoring missing values is not supported).

   Caveat: this procedure is case insensitive and thus you are not guaranteed if "A" is greater than "a", or vice versa. For
   example, if you do:
abc = (/"a","b","c","A","B","C"/)
sqsort(abc)

   then "abc" might be equal to any one of the following permutations:
abc = (/"a","A","b","B","c","C"/)
abc = (/"a","A","B","b","c","C"/)
abc = (/"A","a","b","B","c","C"/)
