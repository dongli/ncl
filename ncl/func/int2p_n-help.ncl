int2p_n

   Interpolates pressure levels to a different set of pressure levels on the given dimension.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

        function int2p_n (
                pin        : numeric,
                xin        : numeric,
                pout       : numeric,
                linlog [1] : integer,
                pdim   [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   pin

   An array of any dimensionality containing input pressure levels. If multi-dimensional, the level dimension must be in the
   pdim-th position and the values must be monotonically increasing or decreasing.
   xin

   An array of any dimensionality containing the data to be interpolated. If pin is multi-dimensional, then these two arrays
   have the same dimension sizes. The level dimension must be in the pdim-th position.
   pout

   An array of any dimensionality containing output pressure levels with values monotonically increasing or decreasing. If
   multi-dimensional, the level dimension must be in the pdim-th dimension and all other dimensions must be the same as xin.
   If one-dimensional, then all of xin will be interpolated to the same levels. Must have the same units as pin.
   linlog

   A scalar integer indicating the type of interpolation:

   abs(linlog) == 1 --> linear interpolation
   abs(linlog) != 1 --> log interpolation

   If linlog is negative, then extrapolation to levels outside the range of pin will occur. Use extrapolation with caution.
   pdim

   A scalar integer indicating which dimension of xin is the level dimension. Dimension numbering starts at 0.

Return value

   The returned array will have the same shape as xin but the pdim-th dimension will have the size of the level dimension of
   pout. The return type will be double if xin is double.

Description

   This function interpolates the values of the pdim-th dimension of xin from one set of pressure levels to another set of
   pressure levels. The interpolation can be either linear or log. Extrapolation is optional. Missing values are allowed,
   but they are ignored.

   You can use int2p if the level dimension is the rightmost dimension.

Examples

   Example 1

begin
  linlog = 2   ; ln(p) interpolation

  pi =(/ 1000.,925.,850.,700.,600.,500.,400.,300.,250., \
          200.,150.,100.,70.,50.,30.,20.,10. /)

  xi =(/ 28., 23., 18., 10.,  2., -4., -15.,-30.,-40., \
        -52.,-67.,-78.,-72.,-61.,-52.,-48.,-46. /)

  po =(/ 1000.,950.,900.,850.,800.,750.,700.,600.,500., \
          425.,400.,300.,250.,200.,100.,85.,70.,50.,40.,\
           30.,25.,20.,15.,10. /)


; Note: you could use "int2p" here as well.
  xo = int2p_n (pi,xi,po,linlog,0)
; xo will contain (/ 28.,24.71,21.37,18. ,...., -48.,-47.17,-46./).
end

   Example 2

   Let p_out be four-dimensional with dimensions time, lat, lon, pout_level. Additionally, p_in and t_in are
   four-dimensional with dimensions time, lat, lon, pin_level. Linearly interpolate with extrapolation.
    linlog = -1
    t_out = int2p_n(p_in,t_in,p_out,linlog,3)
;   t_out is dimensioned time, lat, lon, pout_level

   Example 3

   Similar to example 2, but p_out is one-dimensional:
  t_out = int2p_n(p_in,t_in,p_out,linlog,3)
; t_out is interpolated to the uniform set of pressure levels represented by p_in

   Example 4

   Similar to example 3, but assume the input arrays are dimensioned time x level x lat x lon:

  t_out = int2p_n(p_in,t_in,p_out,linlog,1)
; t_out is dimensioned pout_level, time, lat, lon
