calendar_decode2

   Translates numeric time coordinates to calendar times.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/contrib/calendar_decode2.ncl"

        function calendar_decode2 (
                time       : numeric,
                option [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   time

   An array of numeric time coordinates in one of the supported calendar systems. See dimension restrictions below.

   time@units = Udunits-style time reference string, scalar. E.g. "days since 1800-1-1 00:00:00". The attribute name "units"
   must be lower case. The string value is case insensitive. The units attribute is required.

   time@calendar = name of calendar system, string scalar. E.g. "gregorian". The attribute name "calendar" must be lower
   case. The string value is case insensitive. The calendar attribute is optional. If missing, Gregorian is implied.
   option

   A scalar integer indicating the format of the output. See description below.

Return value

   An array of translated date and time values equivalent to the input time coordinates. The format of the output array is
   selected by the option parameter.

   option = 0 or -5: The result array will be of type float (option 0) or integer (option -5), with one added dimension on
   the right:

     result(:,0) --> years
     result(:,1) --> months
     result(:,2) --> days
     result(:,3) --> hours
     result(:,4) --> minutes
     result(:,5) --> seconds

   Other options: The result array will have the same dimensions as the input array. For a description of the other formats,
   see the documentation for ut_calendar.

Description

   This version contains partial support for several calendar systems described in CF-1 conventions. The COARDS convention
   is also supported, as it uses the Gregorian calendar by default. This is the definitive reference for CF-1:

     http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.4/ch04s04.html

   Supported calendar systems:

   gregorian or standard
          Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar as defined by UDUNITS. This is the default when the "calendar" attribute is
          missing. See caution below.

   proleptic_gregorian
          Gregorian calendar extended to dates before 1582-10-15.

   noleap or 365_day
          Gregorian calendar with no leap years. Every year has 365 days.

   all_leap or 366_day
          Gregorian calendar with every year being a leap year. Every year has 366 days.

   360_day
          All years are 360 days divided into 30 day months.

   Calendar systems in CF-1.4, not currently supported here:

     julian
     "none"

   Custom calendar attributes in CF-1.4, not currently supported here:

     month_lengths
     leap_year
     leap_month

   Caution: When using the "gregorian" calendar system, the UDUNITS mixed Gregorian/Julian interpretation is used.

     http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits

   For the mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar, it is strongly recommended that all encoded dates as well as the reference date
   in the units string be greater than or equal to October 15, 1582. This is the valid start date for the contemporary
   interval of the Gregorian calendar system.

   Restrictions in this version:

   When calendar = "gregorian" or equivalent, this routine defers to NCL's ut_calendar function and includes all of its
   functionality.

   This also applies for "proleptic_gregorian" or equivalent, but only when all dates including the time unit string are
   "safe" dates later than 1582.

   The following apply when any of the other supported calendars are used:

     * Options:
       For proleptic_gregorian calendar with any dates 1852 or earlier, only output options 0 and -5 are supported.
     * Dimensions:
       For output options 0 and -5, all calendars other than gregorian and proleptic_gregorian, the input time variable must
       be scalar or a one dimensional array. For all other output options, there is no restriction on dimensionality.
     * Units string syntax must be one of these three:

     uuuu since y-m-d
     uuuu since y-m-d h:m:s
     uuuu since y-m-d h:m:s.s
       For example:

     days since 1800-1-1
     days since 1800-01-01 0:0:0
     days since 1800-01-01 00:00:0.000
     * Base unit for time (uuuu) must be one of these:

     day or days
     hour or hours
     minute or minutes
     second or seconds
     * The base year must be zero or positive.
     * Time of day in the units string is NOT CHECKED and MUST BE ZERO.
     * (LATER: Time of day in the units string is restricted to zero only.)
     * The time zone suffix in the units string is not supported and must not be included.
     * The global "conventions" attribute is not checked for consistency with calendar attributes encountered.
     * Type and dimension checking of calendar attributes is minimal.

   General notes:

   Following typical conventions, attribute names are CASE SENSITIVE.

   String attribute values are CASE INSENSITIVE.
