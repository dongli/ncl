band_pass_hovmueller

   Create a band-pass filtered time series suitable for a time vs longitude (Hovmueller) plot.

        function band_pass_hovmueller (
                x [*][*][*] : numeric,
                srate   [1] : numeric,
                bpf     [3] : integer,
                wgty    [*] : numeric,
                opt     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val  :  array

Arguments

   x

   A three dimensional variable array. Nominally: (time,lat,lon).
   srate

   Sampling rate. For example: if srate refers to "samples per day", then, srate is one of the following [1,2,4,8,12,24].
   These correspond to [24,12,6,3,2,1] hour sampling rates. Another common sampling unit is "samples per year".
   bpf

   An integer array of length 3. The first two elements contain the band pass start and end times. The last element is the
   number of weights to be used.
   wgty

   A one-dimensional array containing the latitudinal weights.
   opt

   If opt=False, the function will operate under default mode regardless of any attributes associated with the variable.

   If opt=True, then attributes associated with opt may be used to alter the default behavior.

          opt@detrend=True: Series will be detrened. Default: opt@detrend=False.

Return value

   A two-dimensional array [nominally: (time,lon) ] containing areal weighted and band-passed filtered values.

   The following attributes will be associated with the returned variable.

          band_pass_start=bpf(0)
          band_pass_last=bpf(1)
          band_pass_Nwgts=bpf(2)
          var_0, var_1, var_2= string identifiers

Description

   At each time step, weighted latitudinal averages are computed using dim_avg_wgt. The resulting array is band-pass
   filtered in time using Lanczos weights (filwgts_lanczos). The user must be aware that the appropriate number of filter
   weights is a direct function of the band pass period. The shorter the period, the more weights that will be required to
   sufficiently resolve the desired period.

   The input array, x, should have sufficient 'temporal padding' so that the filter will have its desired result over the
   period of interest. For example, if daily mean data, srate=1 (samples per day), are being analyzed and bpf(2)=201, then
   the input array should have 100 (=bpf(2)/2) days padding before and after the time period of focus.

   FYI: The US-CLIVAR MJO working group:
           http://www.usclivar.org/mjo.php

   has suggested a number of diagnostics for evaluating the MJO ( Madden-Julian Oscillation). See their diagnostics website:
     http://climate.snu.ac.kr/mjo_diagnostics/index.htm

   This inclues the statement: "Intraseasonal (20-100 day) bandpass filtered anomalies are constructed using a 201-point
   Lanczos filter, which has half power points at 20 day and 100 day periods."

   Also,

   "No windowing/tapering or de-trending was applied in the calculation of these spectra, since sensitivity tests indicated
   their application had a negligible impact on the results"

Examples

   The following example focuses on the Madden-Julian Oscillatio [MJO]. However, this function is general purpose and can be
   applied to any spatial time series. It can readily be used to focus on other periods interest.

   Example 1

   See Example 5 at Madden Julian Oscillation Climate Variability.

   Example 2

   Consider daily "olr". Extract MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) information using the 20-to-100 day band pass period and
   201 weights as suggested by the WMO CLIVAR Working Group.
