rip_cape_3d

   Computes convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) (deprecated version).

Prototype

        function rip_cape_3d (
                p       : numeric,
                t       : numeric,
                q       : numeric,
                z       : numeric,
                zsfc    : numeric,
                psfc    : numeric,
                opt [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [2,...] :  float or double

Arguments

   p

   An array containing pressure values (hPa); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality as
   t, q, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   t

   An array containing temperature values (K); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality as
   p, q, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   q

   An array containing specific humidities (kg/kg); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same
   dimensionality as p, t, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   z

   An array containing geopotential heights (m); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality
   as p, t, and q. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   zsfc

   A scalar or array containing surface geopotential (terrain) height (m). Must be the same dimensionality as psfc. See the
   description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   psfc

   A scalar or array containing surface pressures (hPa). Must be the same dimensionality as zsfc. See the description
   section for more information on dimension requirements.
   opt

   Set to False for pressure level data. Set to True for terrain-following data.

Return value

   This function returns a 2 x dimsizes(p) array, where index 0 of the leftmost dimension contains the CAPE values, and
   index 1 of the leftmost dimension contains the CIN values.

Description

   ** Note: As of version 5.1.0, this function is obsolete. Use wrf_cape_3d instead.
