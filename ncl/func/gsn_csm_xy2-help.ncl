gsn_csm_xy2

   Creates and draws an XY plot with two different Y axes.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_xy2 (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                x        : numeric,
                y1       : numeric,
                y2       : numeric,
                res1 [1] : logical,
                res2 [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   x

   The X coordinates of both Y curves.
   y1
   y2

   The Y coordinates of each curve. The y1 curve will be represented on the left axis, and the y2 curve will be represented
   on the right axis.
   res1

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources for the first Y curve, attached as attributes. Set to True if
   you want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't
   want the resources applied.

   Note that for setting resources that don't particularly apply to a specific plot, like frame maximization (gsnMaximize),
   a main title (tiMainString), or the three subtitles at the top (gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, gsnRightString), you
   should set these resources with res1, and not res2.
   res2

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources for the second Y curve, attached as attributes. Set to True if
   you want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't
   want the resources applied.

   The res2 resources should only be resources that apply specifically to the x2/y2 data that you are plotting (see example
   below).

Return value

   The return value is the scalar id of the first XY plot created.

   The scalar id of the second XY plot is returned as an attribute called "xy2". This attribute or the return value can be
   used in calls to functions like gsn_add_polymarker or gsn_add_polyline to add primitives to either plot.

   The id of the data object is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change
   some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws an XY plot on the given workstation, with two different Y axes represented. By default,
   the tickmarks will point outward. The plot id returned is the one that represents the left Y axis. The right axis plot id
   is returned as an attribute of the return value called "xy2".

   As with a regular XY plot, NCL will try to pick "nice" values for the Y axes. This means that your two Y axes may not
   line up as expected. To control the Y axes so that the min/max of each has the min/max of your actual data, set the
   trYMinF and trYMaxF resources. For example:

  res1@trYMinF = min(y1)
  res1@trYMaxF = max(y1)
  res2@trYMinF = min(y2)
  res2@trYMaxF = max(y2)

   If any of x, y1, or y2 has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   There are other special gsn resources that apply to XY plots. See the gsn resource page for a full list.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
