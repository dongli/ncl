dim_avg_Wrap

   Computes the average of a variable's rightmost dimension at all other dimensions and retains metadata.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function dim_avg_Wrap (
                x  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality is the same as the first n-2 dimensions of the input variable. That is, the dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   Computes the average of all elements of the n-1th (rightmost) dimension for each index of the dimensions 0...n-2 and
   retains metadata. A wrapper function. Missing values are ignored.

   Use dim_avg_n_Wrap if you want to specify which dimensions to do the average across.

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable (q) of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the average of the rightmost dimension.
    q    = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qAvg = dim_avg(q)   ;==>  qAvg(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let z be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the the zonal mean (ie, average of all non-missing longitudes) is:
    zAvgLon = dim_avg( z )    ; ==> zAvgLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_avg_Wrap function
    zAvgLon = dim_avg_Wrap( x )    ; ==> zAvgLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let z be defined as in Example 2: z(time,lat,lon). Compute the time average of at each latitude/longitude grid point. Use
   NCL's Named Subscripting to reorder the input array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension.

   Note: in V5.1.1, you will be able to use dim_avg_n_Wrap to avoid having to reorder your data.
    zAvgTime = dim_avg( z(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> zAvgTime(nlat,nlon)

    zAvgTime = dim_avg_n( z, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed

   If metadata is desired use
    zAvgTime = dim_avg_Wrap( z(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> zAvgTime(lat,lon)

    zAvgTime = dim_avg_n_Wrap( z, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed
