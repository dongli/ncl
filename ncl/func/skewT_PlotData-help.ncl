        return_val  :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   skewt_bkgd

   The identifier returned from calling skewT_BackGround.
   P

   An array of pressure values (mb/hPa).
   TC

   An array of the same length as P containing temperature values. By default these are assumed to be in Fahrenheit. If you
   are using Celsius, then you need to specify this by setting the dataOpts attribute DrawFahrenheit to False. TC@_FillValue
   may be set to identify missing values.
   TDC

   An array of the same length as P containing dew point temperature values. By default these are assumed to be in
   Fahrenheit. If you are using Celsius, then you need to specify this by setting the dataOpts attribute DrawFahrenheit to
   False. TDC@_FillValue may be set to identify missing values.
   Z

   An array of the same length as P containing geopotential values (gpm). Z@_FillValue may be set to identify missing
   values.
   WSPD

   An array of the same length as P containing wind speed values (knots or m/s). WSPD@_FillValue may be set to identify
   missing values.
   WDIR

   An array of the same length as P containing meteorological wind direction values. WDIR@_FillValue may be set to identify
   missing values.
   dataOpts

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A plot identifier of the Skew T plot created is returned.

Description

   This function plots soundings on a Skew T, Log P background chart that was created by skewT_BackGround. For an overview
   of the information on a Skew T chart, see:

     http://twister.sbs.ohio-state.edu/helpdocs/skew_T_help.html

   skewT_PlotData recognizes missing values as indicated via the _FillValue resource. It is required that the
   skewT_BackGround procedure be called before skewT_PlotData is used, since the position of the plot, the title font, and
   so forth are inherited from the settings for skewT_BackGround.

   If wind speeds and directions are supplied in arguments WSPD and WDIR at places where pressures are missing, then, if
   geopotential values exist at those locations where pressures are missing the geopotential values are mapped (interpolated
   to) pressure values and the wind barbs are drawn at those pressures. These wind barbs are colored using the value of the
   resource "colWindZ".

   There are a number of resources the user can set to alter the Skew T plot. All resource values unique to skewT_PlotData
   are reset to their defaults each time the function is called. For more information about how to use these resources, see
   the examples section below.

   Resource name Default value Description
   PrintZ        True          print geopotential (Z) on skewT diagram
   PlotWindP     True          plot wind barbs at p lvls
   WspdWdir      True          wind speed and dir [else: u,v]
   PlotWindH     False         plot wind barbs at h lvls [pibal; special]
   HspdHdir      True          wind speed and dir [else: u,v]
   ThermoInfo    True          plot CAPE parcel profile if cape > 0
   Parcel        0             subscript corresponding to initial parcel
