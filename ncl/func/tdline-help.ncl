tdline

   Draws the projection of a solid line in 3-space (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdline (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                uvw1 [3] : float,
                uvw2 [3] : float
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier for where you want to draw the surface. The wks identifier is one returned either from
   calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   uvw1
   uvw2

   Float arrays of 3 elements each specifying the begin and end coordinates of the point in 3-space.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDLINE for a full description of this procedure.
