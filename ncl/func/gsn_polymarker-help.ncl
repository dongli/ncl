gsn_polymarker

   Draws polymarkers on the given plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_polymarker (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                plot [1] : graphic,
                x        : numeric,
                y        : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   plot

   A plot identifier created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by calling create to create a View object.
   x
   y

   Multi-dimensional arrays of the same length containing the X and Y coordinates of the polymarkers, and must be in the
   range of the X/Y coordinates of the data in plot. If drawing markers on a map, then X should correspond to longitude
   values, and Y to latitude alues.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of polymarker resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the
   attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the
   resources applied.

Description

   If a missing value is encountered in x and/or y, then this pair is ignored, and no polymarker will be drawn at that pair.

   There are many marker styles available, and you can use the gsMarkerIndex resource to change the marker style. The
   default is an asterisk. You can also create your own marker style using the NhlNewMarker function.

   If you want to resize the plot (i.e. by passing the plot to gsn_panel or setting the vpWidthF or vpHeightF resources),
   then use the function gsn_add_polymarker. This will cause the polymarkers to be attached to the given plot, and hence
   automatically resized when the plot is resized.
