gsn_csm_pres_hgt_vector

   Creates and draws a pressure/height contour plot overlaid with vectors.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_pres_hgt_vector (
                wks      [1] : graphic,
                data  [*][*] : numeric,
                xcomp [*][*] : numeric,
                zcomp [*][*] : numeric,
                res      [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   data

   The two-dimensional data to contour. The leftmost dimension must contain a one-dimensional coordinate array of pressure
   values, and the values must be in the correct units. This is determined by examining the "units" attribute of the
   coordinate variable. Some accepted units are "hpa", "hPa", "Pa", "pa", "mb", "millibars", etc. If the units attribute
   doesn't exist or has the wrong value, an error will be issued.
   xcomp
   zcomp

   The data for the vector plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the vector plot created is returned. The id of the vector data object is returned as an attribute called
   vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an attribute called sfdata. If a separate contour plot is
   created, then an attribute called contour is also returned. These ids are useful if you want to use setvalues to change
   some data or plot options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a pressure/height contour plot with vectors overlaid.

   xcomp usually refers to either the east-west (e.g. u) or north-south (e.g. v) component of the horizontal wind. If the
   plot is a pressure-longitude plot then xcomp refers to the east-west wind component (u). In this case the bottom (x-axis)
   is labeled with longitude labels (e.g. 90E) if a longitude coordinate array exists. If the plot is a pressure-latitude
   plot then xcomp refers to the north-south wind component (v). In this case the bottom (x-axis) is labeled with latitude
   labels (e.g. 30N) if a latitude coordinate array exists.

   The left Y-axis will be labeled with reverse log pressure values, and the right Y-axis with height values in km. The
   height values are a logarithmic interpolation from Standard Atmosphere of the pressure array. The pressure coordinate
   array values must lie between 1013.25 mb and 0.010 mb.

   Important note: by default, NCL maps the vector direction into the underlying coordinate space. This works well when
   drawing vectors on a map projection, but for vertical plots where the two coordinate axes have different units that have
   very different numerical spacing between the coordinate values, it leads to distortion. If you are seeing this issue, try
   setting the resource vcMapDirection to False. This resource now defaults to False for this function in NCL V6.2.0.

   If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   If the resource vcMonoLineArrowColor is set to False, then a labelbar is created. If you want to turn the labelbar off,
   set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
