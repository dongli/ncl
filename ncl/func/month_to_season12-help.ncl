month_to_season12

   Computes three-month seasonal means (DJF, JFM, FMA, MAM, AMJ, MJJ, JJA, JAS, ASO, SON, OND, NDJ).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function month_to_season12 (
                xMon  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  typeof(x)

Arguments

   xMon

   A one-, three-, or four-dimensional array (xMon(time) or xMon(time,lat,lon) or xMon(time,lev,lat,lon) of any numeric
   type.

   xMon must have named dimensions and the time (leftmost) dimension must be divisible by 12. The data are assumed to be
   monthly mean data and the first record is assumed to be January.

Return value

   The return value will be of the same type and dimensionality as xMon. If the input data contains meta data (e.g.
   coordinate variables and attributes), these will be retained.

   In addition, the attribute "season" is returned.

Description

   Computes three-month seasonal means (DJF, JFM, FMA, MAM, AMJ, MJJ, JJA, JAS, ASO, SON, OND, NDJ). The first seasonal
   average (DJF=JF) and the last seasonal average (NDJ=ND) are actually two-month averages.

           Input                 Output
   xMon(time)             xSea(time)
   xMon(time,lat,lon)     xSea(time,lat,lon)
   xMon(time,lev,lat,lon) xSea(time,lev,lat,lon)

Examples

; for xMon(time,lat,lon)

  xSea = month_to_season12 (xMon)

; result: xSea(dimsizes(time),lat,lon)
