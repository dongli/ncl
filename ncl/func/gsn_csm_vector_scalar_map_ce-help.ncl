gsn_csm_vector_scalar_map_ce

   Creates and draws a vector plot over a cylindrical equidistant map projection, and uses a scalar field to draw a separate
   contour plot or color the vectors.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_vector_scalar_map_ce (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                u    [*][*] : numeric,
                v    [*][*] : numeric,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the vector plot; must be two-dimensional.
   data

   The data for which to create a separate contour plot or color the vectors by; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. The id of the vector plot is returned as an attribute called vector. The
   id of the data object is returned as an attribute called vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an
   attribute called sfdata. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has
   been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a vector plot over a cylindrical equidistant map on the given workstation. By default,
   the scalar field is used to color the vectors, unless the special resource gsnScalarContour is set to True, then a
   separate contour plot is created.

   In order for the vectors and contours to be overlaid correctly on the map, please see the document "Overlaying data on a
   map".

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to True so that a cyclic point will be added to the data. Set this resource
   to False if your data is not cyclic, or if you have already added the cyclic point in another fashion.

   The map will be centered at longitude 0 unless you set the resource mpCenterLonF to the desired center longitude.

   If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   If the resource vcMonoLineArrowColor is set to False, then a labelbar is created. If you want to turn this labelbar off,
   set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the latitude/longitude locations will be labeled
     * the tickmarks will point outward

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   If you need more control over the individual vector and contour plots, then it may be easier to create the vector plot
   with gsn_csm_vector, the contour/map plot with gsn_csm_contour_map, and then use the overlay procedure to overlay the
   two. See example "lcnative_overlay_5.ncl" on the Lambert Conformal Native Grid Projection examples page.
