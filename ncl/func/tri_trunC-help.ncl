tri_trunc

   Performs triangular truncation on spherical harmonic coefficients.

Prototype

        procedure tri_trunc (
                a  : float or double,
                b  : float or double,
                T  : integer
        )

Arguments

   a
   b

   Spherical harmonic coefficients returned to user by NCL procedures shagc/shaec.

   T

   Triangular truncation parameter. T is the constant number of total wave numbers to keep.

Description

   tri_trunc performs triangular truncation on coefficients returned by the Spherepack analysis routines shagc or shaec. The
   results are returned in the a and b variables.

Examples

   Example 1

   g(nlat,nlon)

   Array space for a and b must be preallocated by the user prior to calling NCL procedures shagc/shaec.

  a  = new ( dimsizes(g), typeof(g))
  b  = new ( dimsizes(g), typeof(g))

  T  = 19
  shaec(g,a,b)
  tri_trunc (a,b,T)
  shsec(a,b,g)
