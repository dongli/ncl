tdlpdp

   Not yet implemented.

Prototype

        procedure tdlpdp (
        )

Description

   This routine (not yet implemented) is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable
   routines for projecting objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional
   projection plane having X and Y axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to
   somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDLPDP for a full description of this procedure.
