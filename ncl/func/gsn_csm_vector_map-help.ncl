gsn_csm_vector_map

   Creates and draws a vector plot over a map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_vector_map (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                u [*][*] : numeric,
                v [*][*] : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the vector plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the maq plot created is returned. The id of the vector plot is returned as an attribute called vector, and
   the id of the data object is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change
   some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a vector plot over a map on the given workstation. The default projection is a
   cylindrical equidistant, which you can override by setting the mpProjection resource.

   In order for the vectors to be overlaid correctly on the map, please see the document "Overlaying data on a map".

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to True so that a cyclic point will be added to the data. Set this resource
   to False if your data is not cyclic, or if you have already added the cyclic point in another fashion.

   If either u or v have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   If the resource vcMonoLineArrowColor is set to False, then a labelbar is created. If you want to turn this labelbar off,
   set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the latitude/longitude locations will be labeled (cylindrical equidistant and polar stereographic maps only)
     * the tickmarks will point outward (cylindrical equidistant map only)

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
