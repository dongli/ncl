short2flt_hdf

   Converts values of type short to values of type float using the "scale" and "offset" attributes (if present).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function short2flt_hdf (
                x  : short
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float

Arguments

   x

   An array of type short of any dimensionality.

Return value

   The results are returned in a float array of the same type dimensionality as x. Metadata is preserved.

Description

   This function converts short data to float using the "scale" and "offset" attributes (if present), and preserves
   metadata. It assumes that the "offset" is subtracted from the "scale" prior to application to the data.
             x_float = scale*(x_short - offset)

   Other attributes similar to "scale" and "offset" will be recognized:

   offset:
          "add_offset", "OFFSET", "Offset", "_offset", "Intercept", "intercept"

   scale:
          "SCALE", "Scale", "_scale", "scale_factor", "Scale_factor", "Slope" , "slope"

   Note1: This function is slightly different than the built-in set of conversion functions (like floattointeger and
   shorttobyte), because it requires loading the "contributed.ncl" script and it preserves metadata. It has a slightly
   different naming style than the built-in functions, just to set it apart from these other functions.

   Note2: A separate function, short2flt, must be used if the the following approach is to be applied:
             x_float = x_short*scale + offset
