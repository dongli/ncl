fluxEddy

   Calculates time averaged eddy flux quantities.

Prototype

        function fluxEddy (
                x  : numeric,
                y  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   x

   An array with one or more dimensions. The rightmost dimension must be time.
   y

   An array with one or more dimensions. It must have the same dimensions as x.

Return value

   An array of the same size as the input minus the rightmost dimension. Double if any input is double, float otherwise.

Description

   Calculates time averaged eddy flux quantities computed in one pass. Missing values are allowed.The approach used is:
x=X+x'
y=Y+y'

   where X and Y are time averages, then
x'y' = ave{x*y} - X*Y.

Examples

   Example 1 Let x and y be 64 x 128 x 90
    xpyp = fluxEddy(x,y)
;   xpyp = x'y' will be a 64 x 128 array

   Example 2

   Let u and v be four-dimensional with dimensions time, lev, lat, and lon. reorder to make time the rightmost dimension.
  upvp = fluxEddy(u(lev|:,lat|:,lon|:,time|:),v(lev|:,lat|:,lon|:,time|:))
; upvp will be three-dimensional with dimensions lev, lat, lon.

   Example 3

   Calculate the eddy variance of quantity z. (i.e. ave{z'z'}):
    zpzp = fluxEddy(z,z)
