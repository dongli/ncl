gsn_csm_xy

   Creates and draws an XY plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_xy (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                x       : numeric,
                y       : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   x
   y

   The X and Y coordinates of the curve(s). If x and/or y are two-dimensional, then the leftmost dimension determines the
   number of curves.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the XY plot created is returned. The id of the data object is also returned as an attribute called data.
   This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws an XY plot on the given workstation. By default, the tickmarks will point outward.

   If either x or y has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value. If either of the data arrays
   have a "long_name" and/or "units" attribute, these will be used to label the X and Y axes, unless the tickmarks on the X
   or Y axes are explicitly labeled using the tmXBMode or tmYLMode resources.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   There are some special "gsn" resources recognized by this function:

     * gsnYRefLine / gsnXRefLine if either of these are are set to some value, then a vertical or horizontal reference line
       will be drawn at that value.
     * gsnAboveYRefLineColor /gsnBelowYRefLineColor - if either of these resources are set to a color index or named color,
       then the areas between the reference line specified by gsnYRefLine and the Y-curve are filled in the appropriate
       color.
     * gsnXYBarChart - if set to True, then instead of a curve, a bar will be drawn for each Y value. Each bar will be
       centered around its X location.
     * gsnXYBarChartOutlineOnly - if set to True, then instead of a curve, you will get a box outline of your curve. This
       resource is different than the behavior of gsnXYBarChart, because the vertical lines represent the exact location of
       the X values, and not centered about the X values.

   There are other special gsn resources that apply to XY plots. See the gsn resource page for a full list.
