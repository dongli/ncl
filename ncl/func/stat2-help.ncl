stat2

   Calculates the first two moments of the given input.

Prototype

        procedure stat2 (
                x        : numeric,
                xmean    : float,    ; or double
                xvar     : float,    ; or double
                nptused  : integer
        )

Arguments

   x

   An array of any dimensionality. Missing values should be indicated by x@_FillValue. If x@_FillValue is not set, then the
   NCL default missing value will be assumed.
   xmean
   xvar

   (output)
   Variables that will contain the mean and sample variance of x. The dimensions should be the same as x, with the rightmost
   dimension omitted (or a scalar if x is one-dimensional). Space for these variables must be explicitly allocated by the
   user.
   nptused

   (output)
   Variable that will contain the number of points used. It must have the same dimensionality as xmean and xvar, and space
   for it must be explicitly allocated by the user.

Description

   stat2 calculates the first two moments of the rightmost dimension of x containing missing data.

   If ndims represents the number of dimensions in x, then for the leftmost dimensions 0 to ndims-2, the calculations are
   done on the rightmost dimension (ndims-1^th dimension) of the input array.

   This function will be updated in V5.0.0 so that if a subarray of x contains all missing values, stat2 will return missing
   values in the appropriate locations rather than quitting with a fatal error.

Examples

   Run the following example, and then print out the various variables to see how stat2, stat4, stat_medrng, and stat_trim
   work:

begin
;
; Define a 3 x 2 x 2 array
;
   x = (/(/(/1.,2./),(/3.,4./)/),(/(/5.,6./),(/-999,8./)/),\
         (/(/9.,10./),(/11.,-999/)/)/)
   x@_FillValue = -999

   xmean   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xvar    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xskew   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xkurt   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmed    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmrng   = new((/3,2/),float)
   xrng    = new((/3,2/),float)
   xmeant  = new((/3,2/),float)
   xsdt    = new((/3,2/),float)
   npts    = new((/3,2/),integer)

   stat2(x,xmean,xvar,npts)
   print(xmean)
   print(xvar)
   print(npts)

   stat4(x,xmean,xvar,xskew,xkurt,npts)
   print(xmean)
   print(xvar)
   print(xskew)
   print(xkurt)
   print(npts)

   stat_medrng(x,xmed,xmrng,xrng,npts)
   print(xmed)
   print(xmrng)
   print(xrng)
   print(npts)

   stat_trim(x,0.0,xmeant,xsdt,npts)
   print(xmeant)
   print(xsdt)
   print(npts)
end
