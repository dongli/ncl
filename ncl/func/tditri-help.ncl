tditri

   Adds triangles defining an isosurface to a triangle list (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tditri (
                u            [*] : float,
                v            [*] : float,
                w            [*] : float,
                f      [*][*][*] : float,
                fiso         [1] : float,
                rtri     [*][10] : float,
                ntri         [1] : integer,
                render_index [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   u

   A real array dimensioned nu which must be monotonically increasing.
   v

   A real array dimensioned nv which must be monotonically increasing.
   w

   A real array dimensioned nw which must be monotonically increasing.
   f

   A real array dimensioned nw x nv x nu, which, along with u, v, and w, defines the isosurface to be drawn.
   fiso

   A scalar float cutoff value defining the isosurface. The purpose of a call to tditri is to generate a set of triangles
   separating the 3-space box within which the function f is defined into two volumes: one where the value of f is less than
   or equal to fiso and another where the value of f is greater than fiso.
   rtri

   A float input/output array, dimensioned mtri x 10, in which a list of triangles has been stored.
   ntri

   An input/output integer specifying the number of triangles currently in the triangle list.. It is the user's
   responsibility to zero this initially and its value is increased by each call to a triangle-generating routine like
   tditri. If ntri becomes equal to mtri, tditri does not take an error exit; instead, it just stops generating triangles.
   Therefore, it's a good idea, after calling tditri, to check the value of ntri against the dimension mtri; if they're
   equal, it probably means that the triangle list filled up and that the rendered surface will be incomplete.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDITRI for a full description of this procedure.
