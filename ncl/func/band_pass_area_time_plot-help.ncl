band_pass_area_time_plot

   Generate a plot using the output from band_pass_area_time.

        procedure band_pass_area_time_plot (
                x    [3][*] : numeric,  ; [3][time]
                time    [*] : numeric,
                pltDir  [1] : string,

                pltName [1] : string,
                opt     [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   x

   The variable returned from band_pass_area_time.
   time

   The "time" associated with each time step. Generally, this is the same as x&time but this is not required.
   pltDir

   The directory to which the output will be directed. The current directory is indicated by diro="./"
   pltType

   Graphical type to be generated: "png", "x11", "ps", "eps", "pdf", "ncgm".
   pltName

   The name associated with the generated graphic.
   pltName

   If opt=False, the function will operate under default mode regardless of any attributes associated with the variable.

   If opt=True, then attributes associated with opt may be used to alter the default behavior.

   Currently, no options are available.

Description

          Using the variable returned from band_pass_area_time, and its attributes, this procedure will generate multiple
          time series on a panel plot.

Examples

          The following example focuses on the Madden-Julian Oscillatio [MJO]. However, this function is general purpose and
          can be applied to any spatial time series. It can be used to focus on other periods interest.

          Example 1

          Consider daily "olr". Extract MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) information using the 20-to-100 day band pass period
          and 201 weights as suggested by the WMO CLIVAR Working Group.

  f     = addfile("...", "r")
  x     = f->OLR                 ; (time,lat,lon) , ntim=1461

  latS  = -10.              ; select region
  latN  =  10.
  lonL  =  60.              ; Indian Ocean
  lonR  = 280.              ; East Pacific

  spd   = 1                 ; daily means
  bpf   = (/20,100,201/)    ; MJO ... suggested by MJO WG [WMO]
  wgty  = latRegWgt(x&lat, "double", 0)
  opt   = False
                            ; pass in area of interest
  mjo_area = band_pass_area_time (x(:,{latS:latN},{lonL:lonR} \
                                ,spd, bpf, wgty({latS:latN}), opt)

  printVarSummary( mjo_area )
  printMinMax( mjo_area, True)

          The edited output (currently) looks like:
