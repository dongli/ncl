status_exit

   Exits an NCL script passing a status code to the calling environment.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.0.0 and later.

Prototype

        procedure status_exit (
                code  : integer
        )

Arguments

   code

   The status value to be passed to the calling environment.

Description

   Like the exit procedure, this procedure executes the standard C library exit command to exit the NCL script immediately.
   Unlike exit, it passes the value of the code argument to the calling enviroment, that is, the parent process, typically
   some flavor of Unix shell. Note that only the low-order eight bits of the value is actually transmitted.

   The C library defines two standard exit codes, EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE, generally equated to the values 0 and 1
   respectively. Other values may not be universally recognized.

   quit

Examples

   Example 1

   Exit a script with an error if a file is not opened successfully:
f = addfile("no_such_file.nc","r")
if (ismissing(f)) then
    status_exit(42)
end if

   The status value is available (until the next command is issued) in the C shell as $status. In sh, ksh, and bash it can
   be accessed as $?. In bash it is also available as $PIPESTATUS.
