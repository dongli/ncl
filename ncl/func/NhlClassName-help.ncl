NhlClassName

   Retrieve the class name of one or more NCL objects.

Prototype

        function NhlClassName (
                objects [*] : graphic
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(objects)] :  string

Arguments

   objects

   An array of one or more instances of NCL objects. NCL objects are created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by
   calling the NCL create language construct.

Description

   This function returns an array of strings which are the class names of each object of the objects array. This function is
   useful if you need to know what kind of object you have, so you can set or retrieve some resources based on it.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example creates a simple XY plot, and then prints the class name of two of its objects:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
;
; Create workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

;
; Create a data object.
;
  npts = 500
  x    = fspan(0,npts-1,npts)
  y    = 500.+ 0.9 * x * sin(0.031415926535898*x)
  xy   = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,False)

  print(NhlClassName(wks))    ; Should be "xWorkstationClass"
  print(NhlClassName(xy))     ; Should be "xyPlotClass"
end

   Example 2

   This example sets a different color map depending on what kind of workstation is opened:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclex/gsun/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclex/gsun/gsn_csm.ncl"

begin
;
; Create a simple bull's eye pattern test data set
;
  M   = 25
  N   = 25
  T   = new((/N,M/),float)
  jspn = ispan(-M/2,M/2,1)^2
  ispn = ispan(-N/2,N/2,1)^2
  do i = 0, dimsizes(ispn)-1
    T(i,:) = ispn(i) + jspn
  end do
  T = 100.0 - sqrt(8^2 * T)

;
; Start the graphics section.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","bullseye")

;
; Change the colormap based on the type of workstation
; you have.
;
  if(NhlClassName(wks).eq."psWorkstationClass".or.\
     NhlClassName(wks).eq."pdfWorkstationClass") then
    gsn_define_colormap(wks,"rainbow")
  else
    gsn_define_colormap(wks,"BlueRed")
  end if

  cnres                   = True
  cnres@gsnMaximize       = True
  cnres@gsnSpreadColors   = True
  cnres@lbLabelAutoStride = True
  cnres@cnFillOn          = True

  contour = gsn_csm_contour(wks,T,cnres)
end
