run_cor

   Calculates a running correlation.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/contrib/run_cor.ncl"

        function run_cor (
                x     [*] : numeric,
                y     [*] : numeric,
                time  [*] : numeric,
                wSize [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [*] :  numeric

Arguments

   x

   A one-dimensional array of any numeric type.
   y

   An array of any numeric type and the same size as x.
   time

   A one-dimensional numeric array the same size as x and y that represents the time coordinates of x and y. This array must
   have a "units" attribute recognized by ut_calendar.
   wSize

   An integer representing the number of points to include in the running correlation.

Return value

   A one-dimensional array dimensioned npts-wSize-1, where npts represents the length of x and y. The return type will be
   double if x or y are double, and float otherwise.

Description

   This function uses escorc to calculate a running correlation, given a window wSize.

   The window size represents the number of elements to include in the running correlation (time width). Generally we use 11
   year, 15 year, 21 year and so on.

   Suppose the parameters are Xi and Yi, where i=1....n. The return values of run_cor for a wSize=11 is a one dimensional
   array of correlation values of each group of 11 years; i.e. the correlation coefficient for the parameters Xi and Yi
   corresponds to i=1 to 11, i=2 to 12, i=3 to 13, . . . i=(n-10) to n.

   Similarly for wSize=15. The correlation value of each group of 15 years is calculated where Xi and Yi corresponds to i=1
   to 15, i=2 to 16, i=3 to 17,. . . i=(n-14) to n.

   For any time width, the correlation value corresponds to the middle year.
