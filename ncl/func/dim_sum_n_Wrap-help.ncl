dim_sum_n_Wrap

   Computes the arithmetic sum of a variable's given dimensions at all other dimensions and retains metadata.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function dim_sum_n_Wrap (
                x        : numeric,
                dims [*] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   dims

   The dimension(s) of x on which to calculate the sum. Must be consecutive and monotonically increasing.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality will be the same as all but the dims's dimensions of the input variable. The dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by the rank of dims.

Description

   The dim_sum_n_Wrap function computes the sum of all elements of the dimensions indicated by dims for each index of the
   remaining dimensions and retains metadata. A wrapper function. Missing values are ignored.

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable, q, of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the sum of the rightmost dimension.
    q   = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qav = dim_sum_n(q,2)   ;==>  qav(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let x be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the the zonal sum (ie, sum of all non-missing longitudes) is:
    xSumLon = dim_sum_n( x, 2 )    ; ==> xSumLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_sum_n_Wrap function
    xSumLon = dim_sum_n_Wrap( x,2 )    ; ==> xSumLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let x be defined as in Example 2: x(time,lat,lon). Compute the sum over time at each latitude/longitude grid point.

    xSumTime = dim_sum( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xSumTime(nlat,nlon)

    xSumTime = dim_sum_n( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed

   If metadata is desired use
    xSumTime = dim_sum_Wrap( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xSumTime(lat,lon)

    xSumTime = dim_sum_n_Wrap( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed
