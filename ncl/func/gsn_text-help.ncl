gsn_text

   Draws text strings on the given plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_text (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                plot [1] : graphic,
                text     : string,
                x        : numeric,
                y        : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   plot

   A plot identifier created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by calling create to create a View object.
   text

   An array of text strings to draw on the plot.
   x
   y

   Arrays of the same size as text containing the X and Y coordinates of the text strings, and must be in the range of the
   X/Y coordinates of the data in plot. If you are drawing the text on a map, then X should correspond to longitude values,
   and Y to latitude values.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of text resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Description

   This procedure draws text strings on a workstation using NDC coordinates. If a missing value is encountered in the text
   strings or x/y values, then no text string will be drawn at this pair.

   There are many fonts available, and you can use the txFont resource to change the font.

   If you want to resize the plot (i.e. by passing the plot to gsn_panel or setting the vpWidthF or vpHeightF resources),
   then use the function gsn_add_text which will cause the text strings to be automatically resized with the plot.
