rip_cape_2d

   Computes convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), lifted condensation level (LCL), and
   level of free convection (LFC) (deprecated version).

Prototype

        function rip_cape_2d (
                p       : numeric,
                t       : numeric,
                q       : numeric,
                z       : numeric,
                zsfc    : numeric,
                psfc    : numeric,
                opt [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [4,...] :  float or double

Arguments

   p

   An array containing pressure values (hPa); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality as
   t, q, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   t

   An array containing temperature values (K); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality as
   p, q, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   q

   An array containing specific humidities (kg/kg); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same
   dimensionality as p, t, and z. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   z

   An array containing geopotential heights (m); must be ordered top to bottom. This array must be the same dimensionality
   as p, t, and q. See the description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   zsfc

   A scalar or array containing surface geopotential (terrain) height (m). Must be the same dimensionality as psfc. See the
   description section for more information on dimension requirements.
   psfc

   A scalar or array containing surface pressures (hPa). Must be the same dimensionality as zsfc. See the description
   section for more information on dimension requirements.
   opt

   Set to False for pressure level data. Set to True for terrain-following data.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array whose leftmost dimension is 4 (0=CAPE, 1=CIN, 2=LCL, 3=LFC). The rightmost dimension sizes
   depend on the input dimension sizes. The type will be double if any of the input is double, and float otherwise.

   See the description section below for more information.
