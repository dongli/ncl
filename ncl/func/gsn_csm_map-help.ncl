gsn_csm_map

   Creates and draws a map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_map (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some plot options
   after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a map plot on the given workstation. The default projection is a cylindrical equidistant,
   which you can override by setting the mpProjection resource.

   For the map, the following graphical resources will be set internally, which are different from NCL defaults:
     * res@mpOutlineOn = False
       (turn off continental outlines)
     * res@mpFillOn = True
       (turn on map fill)
     * res@mpFillColors = (/"background","transparent","LightGray","transparent"/)
       (fill land in gray and ocean in transparent)
     * res@mpGridAndLimbOn = False
       (turn off lat/lon grid lines)

   If you turn off map fill (res@mpFillOn = False), then the continental outlines will automatically be turned back on.

   A series of other resources will be set internally to label the latitude/longitude locations (cylindrical equidistant and
   polar stereographic maps only) and to point the tickmarks outward (cylindrical equidistant map only).

   Here's comparison between using a "gsn_csm" mapping function, and a generic "gsn" function (click on either thumbnail for
   a larger view):

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
