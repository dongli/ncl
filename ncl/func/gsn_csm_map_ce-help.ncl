gsn_csm_map_ce

   Creates and draws a cylindrical equidistant map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_map_ce (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some plot options
   after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a cylindrical equidistant map plot on the given workstation. The map will be centered at
   longitude 0 unless you set the resource mpCenterLonF to the desired center longitude.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the latitude/longitude locations will be labeled
     * the tickmarks will point outward

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
