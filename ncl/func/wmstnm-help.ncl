wmstnm

   Plots station model data on the given workstation.

Prototype

        procedure wmstnm (
                wks    : graphic,
                x      : float,
                y      : float,
                imdat  : string    ; of 50 characters
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier specifying where you want to draw your station model data. The wks identifier is one
   returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   x
   y

   World coordinate values specifying the center position of the base of the wind barb shaft. These may be multi-dimensioned
   arrays. They must have the same shape.
   imdat

   A string (or array) of 50 characters encoded as per the WMO/NOAA guidelines. If an array, it must have the same shape as
   the x and y arrays. In more detail (where the characters are numbered from left to right, starting at character number
   0):

       character 0    = i[R] - the precipitation data indicator
       character 1    = i[X] - weather data and station type indicator
       character 2    =  h   - height above ground of base of lowest cloud
       characters 3-4 =  VV  - visibility in miles and fractions
       character 5    =  N   - total amount of cloud cover
       characters 6-7 =  dd  - direction from which wind is blowing
       characters 8-9 =  ff  - wind speed in knots

   If character 10 = "1", then

       character 11     = s[n] - sign of temperature
       characters 12-14 = TTT  - current air temperature

   If character 15 = "2", then

       character 16     = s[n] - sign of temperature
       characters 17-19 = T[d] - dew point

   If character 20 = "3", then

       characters 21-24 = PO - station pressure (not plotted)

   If character 25 = "4", then

       characters 26-29 = PPPP - pressure reduced to sea level

   If character 30 = "5", then

       character 31     =  a  - characteristic of barograph
       characters 32-34 = ppp - pressure change, last 3 hrs.

   If character 35 = "6", then

       characters 36-38 = RRR  - precipitation
       character 39     = t[R] - time duration of precipitation

   If character 40 = "7", then

       characters 41-42 =  ww  - present weather
       character 43     = W[1] - most significant past weather
       character 44     = W[2] - 2nd most sig. past weather

   If character 45 = "8", then

       character 46 = N[h] - Fraction of sky cover
       character 47 = C[L] - cloud type, low clouds
       character 48 = C[M] - cloud type, medium clouds
       character 49 = C[H] - cloud type, high clouds

Description

   The procedure wmstnm
   uses the WMSTNM routine from the Wmap package to plot station model data.

   The appearance of the wind barbs that are part of the station model data is controlled by the parameters that control
   wind barbs. See the procedure wmbarb for details.

   It is frequently the case that station model data are drawn over a world map. See Example 2 below for an example. Also,
   see example 5, and example 6 in the weather symbols application page.

   In addition to the wind barb parameters, the parameters VVC, WBC, WBL, and UNT apply to the station model display. WBC
   specifies the diameter of the sky cover circle at the base of the wind barb, WBL specifies the size of the text labels in
   the station model display, and UNT specifies whether you want to use Imperial units (the default) or metric units.

   The procedure wmsetp is used to set parameter values, and the function wmgetp is used to retrieve parameter values.

   The procedure wmstnm does not call frame.

Examples

   Example 1

   See example 1, in the weather symbols application page. The latter two examples show plotting station model data over a
   map.

;
;  Since we want to plot the station model data over a map
;  projection, we have to inform NCL that that is what we
;  are doing.  Setting a value for the internal parameter
;  "ezf" to something other that its default of -1 does this.
;  In addition to this, setting "ezf" will also attenuate the
;  direction of the wind barb based on its latitude.  For
;  example, a wind direction of due north (as in this example)
;  will show the wind barb pointing in the direction of the
;  north pole, rather than straight up.  More accurately, the
;  barb is drawn on the map so that it is tangent to the projection
;  of the local meridian and points northward along that meridian.
;
  wmsetp("ezf",1)

;
;  Station model.
