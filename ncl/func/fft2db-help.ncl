fft2db

   Performs a two-dimensional discrete backward Fourier transform (Fourier synthesis).

Prototype

        function fft2db (
                coef [2][*][*] : numeric
        )

Arguments

   coef

   A three dimensional array containing the real and imaginary parts. Generally, this would be the array created by fft2df.
            input: coef(2,:,:)
where
        real part: coef(0,:,:)
   imaginary part: coef(1,:,:)

Description

   This function computes the discrete backward Fourier transform of a real periodic array. This transform is also known as
   Fourier synthesis, transforming from spectral to physical space.

   A call to fft2df followed by a call to fft2db (or vice-versa) reproduces the original array within roundoff error.

   Missing values are not allowed. For efficiency reasons, no checking for missing values [i.e., _FillValue] is performed.
   Hence, if missing values are present, the results will be erroneous.

   NCL uses FFTPACK5 developed by Paul Swarztrauber and Richard Valent. The specific fortran subroutines used are:

       fft2db:

   Please note that fortran is column major while NCL (like C/C++) is row-major.
