csstri

   Calculates a Delaunay triangulation of data randomly positioned on the surface of a sphere.

Prototype

        function csstri (
                rlat [*] : numeric,
                rlon [*] : numeric
        )

        return_val [*][3] :  integer

Arguments

   rlat
   rlon

   One-dimensional arrays, of the same size, containing latitudes and longitudes, in degrees, of the input data points. The
   first three points must not lie on a common great circle.

Return value

   An integer array, containing triangle vertex indices, dimensioned nt x 3, where nt is the number of triangles in the
   triangulation. Each index in the array references an original data point as it occurs in sequence in the input data set
   (numbering starts at 0). For example, if zo is the returned array and zo(it,0)=5, zo(it,1)=0, and zo(it,2)=2 for some
   index it, then (rlat(5),rlon(5)), (rlat(0),rlon(0)), and (rlat(2),rlon(2)) are the vertices of one of the nt triangles in
   the Delaunay triangulation.

Description

   csstri is in the Cssgrid package - a software package that implements a tension spline interpolation algorithm to fit a
   function to input data randomly spaced on a unit sphere.

   The general documentation for Cssgrid contains complete examples for entries in the package.

   If missing values are detected in the input data, then those values are ignored when calculating the interpolating
   function.

Examples

begin

;
;  Create input arrays.
;
  ndata = 10
  rlat = new(ndata,float)
  rlon = new(ndata,float)

;
;  Create random vertices with latitudes between -90. and 90. and
;  longitudes between -180. and 180.
;
  do i=0,ndata-1
    rlat(i) =  -90. + 180.*rand()/32767.
    rlon(i) = -180. + 360.*rand()/32767.
  end do

;
;  Obtain the triangle vertices.
;
  vertices = csstri(rlat,rlon)

end
