RGBtoCmap

   Reads a text file of RGB triplets and converts them to a colormap.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function RGBtoCmap (
                filename  : string
        )

        return_val [*][3] :  float

Return value

   The results are returned in a float array dimensioned nrows x 3, where nrows is the number of rows in the input file.

Description

   This function reads a text file of RGB triplets (integers that range from 0 to 255) and converts them to a color map that
   is dimensioned nrows x 3 (R,G,B). The first triplet is the background color and the second triplet is the foreground
   color. The RGB values will be normalized (RGB/255). This color map can then be used with a function like
   gsn_define_colormap to define a color map for a workstation.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume you have a file called "rgb.txt" of the following RGB values:
255 255 255
0 0 0
147 112 219
0   0   200
60  100 230
120 155 242
176 224 230

   The following NCL code will read this file and use it to define a new colormap:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"
begin
  cmap = RGBtoCmap("rgb.txt")
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")
  gsn_define_colormap(wks,cmap)
  gsn_draw_colormap(wks)
end
