gsn_text_ndc

   Draws text strings on the given workstation.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_text_ndc (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                text    : string,
                x       : numeric,
                y       : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   text

   An array of text strings to draw on the workstation.
   x
   y

   Arrays of the same size as text containing the X and Y coordinates of the text strings, which must be normalized device
   coordinates (NDC).
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of text resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Description

   If a missing value is encountered in the text strings or x/y values, then no text string will be drawn at this pair.

   There are many fonts available, and you can use the txFont resource to change the font.
