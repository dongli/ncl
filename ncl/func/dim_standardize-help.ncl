dim_standardize

   Calculates standardized anomalies of the rightmost dimension at all other dimensions.

Prototype

        function dim_standardize (
                x    : numeric,
                opt  : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   opt

   Setting opt=1 means to use the population standard deviation (i.e., divide by the number of non-missing value [N]).
   Otherwise, the sample standard deviation is used for normalization (i.e., divide by [N-1]).

Return value

   The output is of type double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

   The dimensionality is the same as the input dimensionality.

Description

   The dim_standardize function calculates and removes the mean from all elements of the n-1th (rightmost) dimension. It
   then standardizes the rightmost dimension by dividing the resulting deviations from the mean by the standard deviation of
   the rightmost dimension. These values are often called standardized anomalies. This is repeated for each index of the
   dimensions 0...n-2. Missing values are ignored.

   Use dim_standardize_n if you want to specify which dimension(s) to do the calculation on.

   Use dim_standardize_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

See Also

   dim_standardize_n, dim_standardize_Wrap, dim_standardize_n_Wrap, dim_median, dim_stddev, dim_num, dim_product, dim_rmsd,
   dim_rmvmean, dim_rmvmed, dim_stat4, dim_stddev, dim_sum, dim_variance

Examples

   Example 1: Let x be a 1-dimensional array: (a) Create a new variable, xNew, that contains standardized values; (b)
   replace the variable x with the standardized values. Use the population standard deviation.

  xNew = dim_standardize(x, 1)    ; new variable
  x    = dim_standardize(x, 1)    ; Or, overwrite with deviations

   Example 2: Let x be a 3-dimensional array with dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). Standardize values of the the
   rightmost (here, "nlon") dimension. Use the sample standard deviation.

   xLon = dim_standardize (x,0)         ; new variable
   xLon = dim_standardize_Wrap( x,0 )   ; with metadata
   x       = dim_standardize (x,0)      ; overwrite with deviations

   Example 3: Let x be a 3-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon).
   Standardize the values of the time dimension at all lat/lon indices, use NCL's Named Subscripting to reorder the input
   array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension.

   Note: in V5.1.1, you will be able to use dim_standardize_n to avoid having to reorder your data.

   xTime = dim_standardize(x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:), 0)
   xTime = dim_standardize_Wrap(x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:), 0)

   xTime = dim_standardize_n(x, 0, 0)         ; no reordering needed
   xTime = dim_standardize_n_Wrap(x, 0, 0)    ; no reordering needed

   Example 4: Let x be as in Example 3 and let x contain monthly means for (say) 10 years of data (ntim=120). Standardized
   monthly anomalies for each month could be calculated using array subscripting and Named Subscripting to reorder the input
   array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension. (opt=0 or 1)

   xJan  = dim_standardize_Wrap(x(lat|:, lon|:, time|0:ntim-1:12), opt)
   xJuly = dim_standardize_Wrap(x(lat|:, lon|:, time|6:ntim-1:12), opt)
