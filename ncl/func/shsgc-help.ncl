shsgc

   Computes spherical harmonic synthesis of a scalar quantity on a gaussian grid via spherical harmonics.

Prototype

        procedure shsgc (
                a  : numeric,
                b  : numeric,
                g  : float or double
        )

Arguments

   a
   b

   spherical harmonic coefficients (input, array with two or more dimensions). If the last two dimensions of g are nlat x
   nlon, then the last two dimensions of a and b must be nlat x N, where N is determined as follow:

     N = minimum(nlat, (nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even
     N = minimum(nlat, (nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd

   In general, a and b were created in the process of doing spherical harmonic analysis via shagc. Note:
     * input values must be in ascending latitude order
     * input arrays must be global

   g

   result of spherical harmonic synthesis of a and b (output, last two dimensions must be nlat x nlon). This must be the
   same size as the array(s) upon which the spherical harmonic analysis was performed. The space for g must be created prior
   to invoking the above procedures.

Description

   shsgc performs the spherical harmonic synthesis on the arrays a and b and store the results in the array g.

   In general, shagc (performs spherical harmonic analysis) will have to be invoked prior to calling shsgc (performs
   spherical harmonic synthesis). Note that both shagc and shsgc operate on a gaussian grid.

   NOTE: This procedure does not allow for missing data (defined by the _FillValue attribute) to be present. g should not
   include the cyclic (wraparound) points, as this procedure uses spherical harmonics. (NCL procedures/functions that use
   spherical harmonics should never be passed input arrays that include cyclic points.)

   Normalization: Let m be the Fourier wave number (rightmost dimension) and let n be the Legendre index (next-to-last
   dimension). Then ab = 0 for n < m.

   The associated Legendre functions are normalized such that:
    sum_lat sum_lon { [ Pmn(lat,lon)e^im lon ]^2 w(lat)/mlon } = 0.25  (m=0)

    sum_lat sum_lon {
          { [ Pmn(lat,lon)e^im lon ]^2
          + [ Pmn(lat,lon)e^i-m lon ]^2 } w(lat)/mlon } = 0.5  (m /= 0)

   where w represents the Gaussian weights:
  sum_lat { w(lat) } = 2.

   If the original input array is on a fixed grid, shsec should be used. Also, note that shsgc is the procedural version of
   shsgC.

Examples

   In the following, assume g is on a gaussian grid, and no cyclic points are included.

   Example 1

   g(nlat,nlon):
   N = nlat
   if (nlon%2 .eq.0) then    ; note % is NCL's modulus operator
     N = min((/ nlat, (nlon+2)/2 /))
   else                      ; nlon must be odd
     N = min((/ nlat, (nlon+1)/2 /))
   end if

   T = 19
   a = new ( (/nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g,a,b)
   tri_trunc (a,b,T)
   shsgc (a,b,g)

   Example 2

   g(nt,nlat,nlon):
   [same "if" test as in example 1]

   a = new ( (/nt,nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nt,nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g,a,b)
      [do something with the coefficients]
   shsgc (a,b,g)

   Example 3

   g(nt,nlvl,nlat,nlon):
   [same "if" test as in example 1]

   T = 19
   a = new ( (/nt,nlvl,nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nt,nlvl,nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g,a,b)
   rhomb_trunc (a,b,T)
   shsgc (a,b,g)

   Note: if g has dimensions, say, nlat = 64 and nlon = 129, where the "129" represents the cyclic points, then the user
   should pass the data to the procedure such that the cyclic points are not included. In the following examples, g is a
   gaussian grid that contains cyclic points. (Remember NCL subscripts start at zero.)

   Example 4

   g(nlat,nlon):
   N = nlat
   M = nlon-1             ; test using the dimension without cyclic pt
   if (M%2 .eq.0) then    ; use M to determine appropriate dimension
     N = min((/ nlat,(M+2)/2 /))
   else                      ; nlon must be odd
     N = min((/ nlat,(M+1)/2 /))
   end if

   a = new ( (/nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g(:,0:M-1), ,a,b)    ; only use the non-cyclic data
        [do something with the coefficients]
   shsgc (a,b, g(:,0:M-1))
   g(:,M) = g(:,0)         ; add new cyclic pt

   Example 5

   g(nt,nlat,nlon) where nlat=64 and nlon=129 and the "129" represents the cyclic points:
   [same "if" test as in example 4]

   a = new ( (/nt,nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nt,nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g(:,:,0:nlon-2), a,b)
      [do something with the coefficients]
   shsgc (a,b, g(:,:,0:nlon-2))
   g(:,:,nlon-1) = g(:,:,0)         ; add new cyclic pt

   Example 6

   g(nt,nlvl,nlat,nlon) where nlat=64 and nlon=129 and the "129" represents the cyclic points:
   [same "if" test as in example 4]

   a = new ( (/nt,nlvl,nlat,N/), float)
   b = new ( (/nt,nlvl,nlat,N/), float)
   shagc (g(:,:,:,0:nlon-2), a,b)
        [do something with the coefficients]
   shsgc (a,b, g(:,:,:,0:nlon-2))
   g(:,:,:,nlon-1) = g(:,:,:,0)         ; add new cyclic pt

Errors

   If jer or ker is equal to:

     1 : error in the specification of nlat
     2 : error in the specification of nlon
     4 : error in the specification of N (jer only)
