delete_VarAtts

   Deletes one or more attributes associated with a variable.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.2.0.a034 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        procedure delete_VarAtts (
                var   ,
                atts
        )

Arguments

   var

   Any valid variable.
   atts

   A variable of type string or integer. If it is of type string then it can be a single element or a one dimensional array
   specifying the names of the attributes to be deleted.

   If it is of type integer (by convention =-1) then all the attributes associated with the variable var will be deleted

Description

   This procedure checks to see if each specified attribute exists. If it does exist, it is deleted.

See Also

   There are many metadata tools.

Examples

   The following require that contributed.ncl be loaded prior to invoking the function.
       load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

   Example 1

   Let the variable x have 5 attributes: "apple", "peach", "orange", "banana", "pineapple". Let's say that 3 attributes
   ("peach", "banana", "pineapple") are to be deleted while the others ("apple", "orange") are to be retained. The classic
   approach would be:
      delete(x@pineapple)
      delete(x@peach)
      delete(x@banana)

   Using the delete_VarAtts procedure:
      delete_VarAtts(x,(/"pineapple","peach","banana"/))

   Example 2

   Let the variable x have 50 attributes: Delete all the attributes associated with x
      delete_VarAtts(x, -1)
