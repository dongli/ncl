fo2fsh_Wrap

   Interpolates a scalar quantity from a fixed-offset grid to a fixed grid (retains metadata).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function fo2fsh_Wrap (
                grid  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   grid

   An array of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. The values must be in
   ascending latitude order.

Return value

   The return array dimensions are the same as grid's dimensions, except the latitude dimension (nlata) is increased by one.
   For example, a 5 degree fixed-offset grid would have dimensions nlata=36, nlona=72 and the return fixed grid would have
   dimensions nlatb=37, nlonb=72. The type will be double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   fo2fsh_Wrap interpolates a scalar quantity on a fixed-offset grid to a fixed grid using spherical harmonics (via the
   Spherepack code). Values will be in ascending latitude order.

   If missing values are encountered in a 2D subsection of the input array, then no interpolation will be performed on that
   2D array, and the corresponding 2D subsection of the return array will be filled with missing values.

   Arrays which have dimensions [...] x nlata x nlona should not include the cyclic (wrap-around) points when invoking this
   function. For example, if an array x has dimensions nlata = 64 and nlona = 129, where the "129" represents the cyclic
   point, then the user should pass the data to fo2fsh_Wrap via:
  z = fo2fsh_Wrap ( x(...,0:nlona-2) )  ; does not include cyclic points

   This function can only be used on grids that span the globe. It cannot be used for limited area grids.

   Please read the caveats that you should be aware of when using spherical harmonic regridding.

   This function is identical to the built-in function fo2fsh except it retains metadata.

Examples

   Assume x is dimensioned nt x nlat x nlon. The code below interpolates from a fixed offset 2.5 degree grid (nlat=72,
   nlon=144) to a fixed grid with 2.5 degree resolution (jlat=73, ilon=144):

  X = fo2fsh_Wrap (x)        ; ==> X(nt,jlat,ilon)

Errors

   ier is equal to:

     4 or 10 if nlona is less than 4
     5 or 10 if nlata is less than 3
     8 if nlonb is less than 4
     9 if nlatb is less than 3
