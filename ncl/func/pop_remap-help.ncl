pop_remap

   Regrids a POP ocean model grid to another grid.

Prototype

        procedure pop_remap (
                x_dst      [*] : numeric,
                map_wts [*][*] : numeric,
                dst_add    [*] : integer,
                src_add    [*] : integer,
                x_src      [*] : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   x_dst

   (output)
   A one-dimensional array representing all points in the destination grid. The size is determined by the SCRIP software's
   variable dst_grid_dims. Must be the same type as x_src.
   map_wts

   A two-dimensional array equal to the remapping weights. The dimension order is (num_links,num_wgts) using SCRIP
   nomenclature.
   dst_add

   An one-dimensional array equal to the destination addresses.
   src_add

   An one-dimensional array equal to the source addresses.
   x_src

   A one-dimensional array representing all points in the source grid. Must be the same type as x_dst

Description

   Regrids a POP ocean model grid to another grid using weights, source addresses and destination addresses from the SCRIP
   (Spherical Coordinate Remapping and Interpolation Package). Only users familiar with SCRIP should use this function.
   This routine performs the appropriate first-order multiplication between the values in a one dimensional representation
   of the source grid and derived weights. The output is a one dimensional representation of the output grid.
   ndtooned and onedtond can be used to perform the transformations between multi-dimensional arrays and one dimensional
   arrays.
   It is the user's responsibility to read in the appropriate data from a SCRIP file.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let Src_to_Dst.nc represent the SCRIP file with the desired regridding information. Let XIN be the two-dimensional source
   grid and XOUTbe the two-dimensional destination grid.
fP = addfile("Src_to_Dst.nc","r")    ; SCRIP netCDF file

dim_x   = dimsizes( XIN )             ; XIN is the variable to be remapped
nDx     = dimsizes( dim_x )           ; rank [# dimensions]
dim_src = fP->src_grid_dims           ; size source grid
                                      ; error check
if (dim_x(nDx-2).ne.dim_src(1) .or. dim_x(nDx-1).ne.dim_src(0)) then
    print (" Input grid and Remap sizes do not match")
    exit
end if

dst_add = fP->dst_address              ; destination grid [linear]
src_add = fP->src_address              ; source grid [linear]
map_wts = fP->remap_matrix             ; wts
dim_dst = fP->dst_grid_dims            ; size destination grid

mx      = dim_dst(0)                   ; output # elements in "x"
ny      = dim_dst(1)                   ; output # elements in "y"

xout_1D = new (ny*mx, typeof(XIN))    ; (temporary) return grid [1D]
xin_1D  = ndtooned ( XIN )            ; convert to 1D

pop_remap(xout_1D, map_wts, dst_add, src_add, xin_1D)

XOUT = onedtond(xout_1D, (/ny,mx/) )   ; new grid

delete(xout_1D)                        ; clean up
delete(xin_1D)
delete(dst_add)
delete(src_add)
delete(map_wts)
