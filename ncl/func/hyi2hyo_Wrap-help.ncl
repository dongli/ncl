        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   p0

   A scalar value equal to the surface reference pressure. Must have the same units as ps.
   hyai

   A one-dimensional array containing the hybrid coefficients A associated with xi. Must be ordered top-to-bottom. Must be
   unitless.
   hybi

   A one-dimensional array containing the hybrid coefficients B associated with xi. Must be ordered top-to-bottom. Must be
   unitless.
   ps

   A multi-dimensional array containing pressures. Must be at least two dimensions and one dimension smaller than xi. The
   level dimension is ordered top-to-bottom. Must have the same units as p0.
   xi

   A multi-dimensional array containing the variable to be interpolated. The three rightmost dimensions must be level, lat,
   and lon. The level dimension is ordered top-to-bottom.
   hyao

   A one-dimensional array containing the hybrid coefficients A associated with the return_val. Must be ordered
   top-to-bottom. Must be unitless.
   hybo

   A one-dimensional array containing the hybrid coefficients B associated with the return_val. Must be ordered
   top-to-bottom. Must be unitless.
   intflg

   A scalar integer which specifies the type of extrapolation to be used. A value of 0 will cause all values outside of
   input pressure range to to be set to xi's missing value (or 1e20 if none). A value of 1 will set output values to the
   closest input pressure level.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array of the same size as xi except that the level dimension has been replaced by the size of hyao.
   Double if xi or ps are double, float otherwise. float.

Description

   Interpolates from data on one set of hybrid levels to another set of hybrid levels. It is assumed that hyai, hyab, ps and
   xi are from the same source.

   The basic approach is to calculate the pressures at each level for the input and output hybrid levels. Then interpolate
   in the input variable to the pressures of the desired output hybrid levels. Log-linear interpolation is used.
   At each latitude, longitude and level (lev[k]) pressures are computed using:
             p(k) = A(k)*PO + B(k)*PS            (1)

   This is the form used by the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and it is the form expected by hyi2hyo. A visualization of
   the hybrid coordinate system is here. Typically, the A and B coefficients might have values like:
  A = 0.0048093, 0.0130731, 0.0325591, 0.0639471, 0.0816768, 0.0780201,
      0.0733671, 0.0676476, 0.0608624, 0.0531095, 0.0445995, 0.0356607,
      0.0267266, 0.0183069, 0.0109421, 0.005147 , 0.0013519, 0 ;

  B = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0173664, 0.0606928, 0.1158237, 0.1835918, 0.2639851,
      0.3558459, 0.456676, 0.5625875, 0.6684428, 0.768203, 0.8554653,
      0.9241285, 0.9690938, 0.9925282 ;

   If the "A" and "B"coefficients are different from (1) then it is the users responsibility to make the appropriate
   changes. For example, an alternative form of (1) is:
             p(k) = AP(k) + B(k)*PS             (2)

   In this form, each AP coefficient AP(k)=A(k)*PO. In this case the value of p0 input to hyi2hyo should be set to one
   [1.0].

Examples

   Example 1

   This example interpolates a variable from ECMWF's 60 hybrid level model to a different set of hybrid levels (26 here).

   diri = "./"
   filC = "sstclimt42_run01.cam2.h0.0001-01.nc"    ; CAM
   filU = "e4moda.an.ml.t85.u.1985.nc"             ; ECMWF [ds126.2]
   filP = "e4moda.an.ml.t85.psfc.1985.nc"          ; ECMWF [ds126.2]

   f    = addfile (diri+filU, "r")
   hyai = f->hyam                                  ; midlayer coef
   hybi = f->hybm
   ui   = f->U                                     ; variable to be interpolated
   p0   = f->P0                                    ; reference pressure (Pa)
   fP   = addfile (diri+filP, "r")
   psfc = fP->PSFC                                 ; surface pressure (Pa)

   fC   = addfile (diri+filC, "r")
   hyao = fC->hyam                                 ; levels to which the variable
   hybo = fC->hybm                                 ; will be interpolated

   uo = hyi2hyo_Wrap(p0,hyai,hybi,psfc,ui,hyao,hybo,0)
   printVarSummary(uo)
