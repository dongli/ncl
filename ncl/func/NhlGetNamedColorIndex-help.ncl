NhlGetNamedColorIndex

   Returns color map indexes that match the given color names in the color maps of the given workstations.

Prototype

        function NhlGetNamedColorIndex (
                wks         : graphic,
                color_name  : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(wks)][dimsizes(color_name)] :  integer

Arguments

   wks

   An array of any dimensionality of NCL Workstation identifiers. The identifiers are ones returned either from calling
   gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   color_name

   An array of any dimensionality of named colors from the $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database/rgb.txt file.

Return value

   The array returned will be dimensioned nwks x ncm, where nwks represents the dimensions of wks, and ncm represents the
   dimensions of color_name. If only one workstation is given, then the dimensions of the output will be equal to the
   dimensions of color_name.

Description

   The NhlGetNamedColorIndex function looks up the given color names in the color maps of the given workstations and returns
   an integer array of color indexes for each workstation id that represents the closest match to each color. If a bogus
   color name is given, then the color index returned will be negative.

   Note that you can not input "foreground" and "background" to this function, as they are not considered named colors.
   These two are just special keywords that are substitutes for color indices 1 and 0 respectively.

Examples

   Example 1

   If you have the following NCL script:
begin
  wks = create "workstation" ncgmWorkstationClass defaultapp
    "wkColorMap" : (/"white","black","red","green","blue","yellow",\
                     "cyan","magenta"/)
  end create

  i = NhlGetNamedColorIndex(wks,(/"red","yellow","blue","green",\
                                   "cyan","magenta"/))
  j = NhlGetNamedColorIndex(wks,(/"gray","brown"/))
  print(i)
  print(j)
end

   then i will be equal to (/2,5,4,3,6,7/) and j will be equal to (/0,2/). There's no gray or brown defined in the above
   color map, so when the color map is searched for the closest match to gray and brown, it comes up with white and red,
   which are color indexes 0 and 2.

   Example 2

   If you have the following NCL script, where the NCGM workstation uses the default color map, and the PS workstation uses
   the temp1 color map:
begin
  ncgm = create "workstation" ncgmWorkstationClass defaultapp
  end create

  ps = create "workstation" psWorkstationClass defaultapp
    "wkColorMap" : "temp1"
  end create

  i = NhlGetNamedColorIndex((/ncgm,ps/),(/"red","yellow","blue","green",\
                                   "cyan","magenta"/))
  print(i)
end

   then i will be equal to (/(/2,5,4,3,6,7/),(/62,38,16,31,24,6/)/).
