NhlNDCToData

   Converts normalized device coordinates (NDCs) into data coordinates.

Prototype

        procedure NhlNDCToData (
                plot  [1] : graphic,
                x_in  [*] : float,
                y_in  [*] : float,
                x_out [*] : float,
                y_out [*] : float
        )

Arguments

   plot

   A plot object that can be created by using one of the many gsn plotting functions, or by calling the NCL create language
   construct.
   x_in
   y_in

   One-dimensional arrays of x and y NDC coordinates. They must be the same length.
   x_out
   y_out

   (output)
   One-dimensional arrays of the same size as x_in and y_in. These will contain the x and y data coordinate output values.
   For map plots, x_out corresponds to longitude values, and y_out corresponds to latitude values.

Description

   The NhlNDCToData procedure uses the built-in transformation mapping feature of NCL plot objects to map NDC coordinates
   into data coordinates.

   The NhlNDCToData procedure maps coordinate pairs from x_in and y_in and places the results in the corresponding elements
   of x_out and y_out, respectively. Both x_out and y_out can be the same variables as x_in and y_in.

   When the data coordinates are outside the NDC viewport specified in the plot, a missing value is placed in both of the
   corresponding indexes in the output arrays. The missing value chosen is either the x_in missing value, y_in missing
   value, or a system default.

   Note: this procedure is identical to the NhlNDCToData procedure, and we encourage the use of NhlNDCToData instead (saves
   having to type longer names and capital letters).
