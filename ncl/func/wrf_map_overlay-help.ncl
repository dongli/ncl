wrf_map_overlay

   Overlays different plot id's over a map background (deprecated in version 5.1.0).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

        procedure wrf_map_overlay (
                wks       : graphic,
                map       : graphic,
                plots [*] : graphic,
                res   [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to
   create a Workstation object.
   map

   Graphical map background, possibly created by a call to wrf_map.
   plots

   Plots to overlay over map background, possibly created by calls to wrf_contour and/or wrf_vector.
   res

   A plot resource. Set to True if you want to advance the frame before creating the next frame. Set to False if you do not
   want to advance the frame. Use False only if you plan on adding additional text/lines/symbols to the frame before
   advancing it.

Description

   This procedure will be deprecated in version 5.1.0. Use the much more versatile function wrf_map_overlays instead.

   Overlay a number of graphical plots over a map background on the given workstation.

   wrf_map_overlay is part of a library of functions and procedures in WRFUserARW.ncl written to help users plot ARW WRF
   model data.

   WRF-related questions should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

  time = 1
  slp = wrf_user_getvar(a,"slp",time)  ; slp
        wrf_smooth_2d( slp, 3 )        ; smooth slp

  tc2 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"T2",time)   ; T2 in Kelvin
  u10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"U10",time)  ; u at 10 m
  v10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"V10",time)  ; v at 10 m

  map = wrf_map(wks,a,True)

  rest = True
  rest@cnFillOn = True
  contour_t = wrf_contour(a,wks,tc2,rest)

  resp = True
  resp@cnLineColor = "NavyBlue"
  contour_p = wrf_contour(a,wks,slp,resp)

  resw = True
  vector = wrf_vector(a,wks,u10,v10,resw)

  wrf_map_overlay(wks,map,(/contour_t,contour_p,vector/),True)
