tdprpa

   Retrieves the coordinates of a projection in the projection plane, given the parallelogram coordinates of a point (for
   use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function tdprpa (
                xyipa [2] : float
        )

        return_val [2] :  float

Arguments

   xyipa

   A float array of 2 elements defining the parallelogram coordinates of a point.

Return value

   A float array of two elements containing the coordinates of the projection of the point in the projection plane.

Description

   This function is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDPRPA for a full description of this function.
