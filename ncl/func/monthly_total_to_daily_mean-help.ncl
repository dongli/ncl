Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function monthly_total_to_daily_mean (
                yyyymm [*] : numeric,
                x          : numeric,
                opt    [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   yyyymm

   Year-month dates [eg 198401,198402,...]. This must be the same size as the "time" dimension of x.
   x

   An array containing monthly values. Typically, this is monthly precipitation totals. The "time" dimension must be the
   leftmost dimension if there are multiple dimensions.
   opt

   Currently, not used. Set to zero [0].

Return value

   Returns an array the same size as x. All values have been divided by the number of days in a month.

Description

   Typical usage is that an array of monthly precipitation totals (eg, mm) are input. Each value is divided by the number of
   days in the month to return mm/day. Leap year Februaries use 29 days.

Examples

   Example 1

   An array of monthly precipitation totals [mm] is to be converted to mm/day. Typically, the array takes the form
   prc(time), prc(time,stations) or prc(time,lat,lon).
           prc_day = monthly_total_to_daily_mean(yyyymm, prc, 0)
