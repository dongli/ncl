tdprpt

   Retrieves the coordinates of its projection in the projection plane, given the coordinates of a point in 3-space (for use
   with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function tdprpt (
                uvwi3d [3] : float
        )

        return_val [2] :  float

Arguments

   uvwi3d

   A float array of 3 elements defining the coordinates of a point in 3-space.

Return value

   A float array of two elements containing the coordinates of the projection in 2-space.

Description

   This function is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDPRPT for a full description of this function.
