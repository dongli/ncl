dim_avg_wgt

   Computes the weighted average of a variable's rightmost dimension at all other dimensions.

Prototype

        function dim_avg_wgt (
                x       : numeric,
                w   [*] : numeric,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality. Missing values are indicated by the _FillValue attribute.
   w

   A one dimensional array of weights. The length must the same as the right dimension of x
   opt

   A scalar: (a) opt=0 means compute the weighted average only if all values are not missing; (b) opt=1 means compute the
   weighted mean of all non-missing values; (c) opt>1 means to return the mean only if the number of non-missing values is
   greater-then or equal to opt.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality is the same as the first n-2 dimensions of the input variable. That is, the dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   The dim_avg_wgt function computes the weighted average of all elements of the n-1th (rightmost) dimension for each index
   of the dimensions 0...n-2.

   Basically, the following is done for the rightmost dimension.

    xAvg = SUM [x*w]/SUM[w]

   The weighting is strictly positional. EG: If x@_FillValue=1e20, and the rightmost dimension is of size 5 and the values
   are (/3.7, 1e20, 14.3, 1e20, 7.1 /) with weights (/1,3,5,3,1/) then the result will be
      (3.7*1 + 14.3*5 + 7.1*1)/(1+5+1) = 11.757

   Use dim_avg_wgt_n if you want to specify which dimension to do the weighted average across.

   Use dim_avg_wgt_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let z(12,nlat,mlon) contain monthly means and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Compute the
   weighted annual mean at each lat/lon point. Use dimension reordering to make time the rightmost dimension.

   Note: in V5.1.1, you will be able to use dim_avg_wgt_n to avoid having to reorder your data.

    wgt = (/0.08493151, 0.076712325, 0.08493151, 0.08219178 \  ; same size as dimension "time"
           ,0.08493151, 0.08219178 , 0.08493151, 0.08493151 \
           ,0.08219178, 0.08493151 , 0.08219178, 0.08493151 /)
    zAnn = dim_avg_wgt( z(lat|:,lon|:,time|:), wgt, 0 )    ; ==> zAnn(nlat,mlon)

    zAnn = dim_avg_wgt_n( z, wgt, 0, 0)                    ; no reordering needed

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_avg_wgt_Wrap function.

   Example 2

   Let T(time,lev,lat,lon). Compute the weighted vertical average total at each time/lat/lon point. Use dimension reordering
   to make level the rightmost dimension.
    wgt  = (/50,50,100,100,100,50,25,10/)  ; same size as dimension "lev"

    Tavg = dim_avg_wgt( T(time|:,lat|:,lon|:,lev|:), wgt, 0 )   ; ==> Tavg(time,lat,lon)

    Tavg = dim_avg_wgt_n( T, wgt, 0, 1 )   ; no reordering needed
