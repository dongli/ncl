gsn_vector_scalar_map

   Creates and draws a vector plot over a map, and colors the vectors using the given scalar field.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_vector_scalar_map (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                u    [*][*] : numeric,
                v    [*][*] : numeric,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res     [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the vector plot; must be two-dimensional.
   data

   The data for which to color the vectors by; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. The id of the vector plot is returned as an attribute called vector. The
   id of the data object is returned as an attribute called vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an
   attribute called sfdata. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has
   been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a vector plot over a map on the given workstation, and colors the vectors given a scalar
   field. If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   You should use gsn_csm_vector_scalar_map if you want a more customized vector plot, if you want the scalar field to be
   represented as a separate contour plot, and/or if any of your data has coordinate arrays. To maximize the area that the
   vector plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
