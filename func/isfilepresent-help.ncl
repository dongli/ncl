isfilepresent

   Checks if a supported file exists.

Prototype

        function isfilepresent (
                file_path  : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(file_path)] :  logical

Arguments

   file_path

   A scalar string or a multi-dimensional array of strings containing the full or relative path to supported data files
   (Unix pathname string) for which to check presence on the filesystem.

Return value

   The output of isfilepresent is a logical variable with the same dimension sizes as the input.

Description

   The function isfilepresent returns True for every element of file_path that is present and a supported file format, and
   False if not.

   Note about backwards-incompatible change: as of NCL V6.2.1, this function will only return True if the file is present
   and it is a supported format recognized by addfile. To check for the existence of any other kind of file, use the new
   fileexists function.

Examples

   Example 1

   The following code will determine if a HDF file named test.hdf exists:
  if (isfilepresent("test.hdf"))
    f = addfile ("test.hdf", "r")
  end if

   Example 2

   The following code will determine if each of a group of files exists:
; specify data directory and get a list of all nc files in the directory
  datadir = getenv("NCARG_ROOT") + "/lib/ncarg/data/cdf/"
  ncdf    = systemfunc("cd "+datadir; "ls *.nc")

; list of files to check
  fils = (/ "bogus.nc" , "ex01B1_uv300.hs.nc", "foo.nc", "sst30e_netcdf.nc"/)

; Which of "fils" is present
  fils_tf  = isfilepresent(datadir+fils)

  print (fils_tf)

   Output:
Variable: fils_tf
Type: logical
Total Size: 16 bytes
            4 values
Number of Dimensions: 1
Dimensions and sizes:   [4]
Coordinates:
(0)     False
(1)     True
(2)     False
(3)     True

   Example 3

   Here's an example that shows how to access a file being served by an OPeNDAP server, and to test if your version of NCL
   has OPeNDAP capability built into it:
begin
; The URL is so long, break it into two pieces.
  url      = "http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nph-nc/Datasets/"
  filename = "ncep.reanalysis.dailyavgs/pressure/air.1948.nc"

  exists = isfilepresent(url+filename)
  if(.not.exists) then
    print("OPeNDAP test unsuccessful.")
    print("Either the file doesn't exist, or NCL does")
    print("not have OPeNDAP cabilities on this system.")
  else
    f = addfile(url + filename,"r")
    variables = getfilevarnames(f)
    print(variables)     ; should be (/"air","time","lon","lat","level"/)
  end if
end
