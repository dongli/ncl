filevarattdef

   Copies attributes from an input variable to one or more variables on a supported file.

Prototype

        procedure filevarattdef (
                thefile [1] : file,
                varnames    : string,
                variable
        )

Arguments

   thefile

   The reference to the file that you want to write the variable attributes to. This reference must be created by the
   addfile function.
   varnames

   A list of file variable names to which you want to copy attributes.
   variable

   A variable, of any type, which contains one or more attributes to assign to the file variables listed in varnames.

Description

   This procedure copies attributes from the input variable to the output file variables, named by varnames. The variables
   in varnames must already be defined either through the procedure filevardef or through normal assignment.

Examples

   Write variables "gw" and "lat" to a netCDF file (with named dimension "lat"), and attach some attributes:
  ncf = addfile("myfile.nc","c")
;
; Define variable attributes.
;
  filedimdef(ncf , "lat", 73 , False)
  filevardef( ncf, "lat", "float", "lat" )
  latAtt=0
  latAtt@units     = "degrees_north"
  latAtt@long_name = "latitude"
  filevarattdef( ncf, "lat", latAtt )

  filevardef( ncf, "gw", "float", "lat" )
  gwAtt=0
  gwAtt@long_name  = "gauss weights"
  filevarattdef( ncf, "gw", gwAtt )

   "ncdump myfile.nc" produces the following output:
netcdf myfile {
dimensions:
        lat = 73 ;
variables:
        float lat(lat) ;
                lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
                lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
        float gw(lat) ;
                gw:long_name = "gauss weights" ;
data:

 lat = [snip ... all values]

 gw  = [snip ... all values]
}
