tdgtrs

   Gets the definition of a specified rendering style (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdgtrs (
                render_index    [1] : integer,
                bot_fill_index1 [1] : integer,
                bot_fill_index2 [1] : integer,
                top_fill_index1 [1] : integer,
                top_fill_index2 [1] : integer,
                bot_line_index  [1] : integer,
                top_line_index  [1] : integer,
                draw_edge       [1] : integer,
                udist           [1] : float,
                vdist           [1] : float,
                wdist           [1] : float
        )

Arguments

   render_index

   An input integer scalar specifying the index of the rendering style to be retrieved. See the low-level "Rendering-Style
   Arrays" section for descriptions of the internal parameters defining the rendering styles.
   bot_fill_index1
   bot_fill_index2

   Color indices (output) that will contain a range of colors used for the "bottom" side of a surface (where function values
   are less than the value on the surface).

   top_fill_index1
   top_fill_index2

   Color indices (output) that will contain a range of colors used for the "top" side of a surface (where function values
   are greater than the value on the surface).

   bot_line_index
   top_line_index

   Color indices (output) that will contain colors used for lines drawn on the "bottom" or "top" side of a surface. If
   either one is set to a negative value, the drawing of those lines is turned off.
   draw_edge

   An integer scalar (output) that will contain a flag that indicates whether the edges of the individual triangles will be
   drawn.
   udist
   vdist
   wdist

   Float scalars (output) that will contain the distances between slices in the U, V, and W directions, respectively.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDGTRS for a full description of this procedure.
