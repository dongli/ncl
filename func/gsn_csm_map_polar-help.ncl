gsn_csm_map_polar

   Creates and draws a polar stereographic map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_map_polar (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map plot created is returned. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some plot options
   after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a polar stereographic map plot on the given workstation. The default is to show only the
   northern hemisphere, unless the special resource gsnPolar is set to "SH".

   This function puts special longitude labels around the polar map. These labels can be controlled only through a limited
   set of gsnPolar* resources. To turn off the labels completely, set the resource gsnTickMarksOn to False.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the longitude locations will be labeled

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
