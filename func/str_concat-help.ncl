str_concat

   Concatenates all strings into a single string.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function str_concat (
                string_val  : string
        )

        return_val [1] :  string

Arguments

   string_val

   A string array of any dimensionality.

Description

   This function concatenates all the input strings into a single string.

   If any of the strings are missing, then the missing value string will be included in the concatenation. It's up to the
   user to remove missing strings if this behavior is not desired (see example below).

Examples

   Example 1

  strs = (/"NCL","has","many","features","common","to","modern","programming","languages."/)
  new_str = str_concat(strs)
  print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCLhasmanyfeaturescommontomodernprogramminglanguages.

   Example 2

   See what happens when you have missing value strings:
  strs = (/"NCL","has","many","features","missing","common","to", \
           "missing","modern","programming","languages.","missing"/)
  strs@_FillValue = "missing"

  new_str = str_concat(strs)
  print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCLhasmanyfeaturesmissingcommontomissingmodernprogramminglanguages.missing

   If this behavior is not desired, then replace the missing strings with "":
  strs = where(ismissing(strs),"",strs)
  new_str = str_concat(strs)
  print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCLhasmanyfeaturescommontomodernprogramminglanguages.
