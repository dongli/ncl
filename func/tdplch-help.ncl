tdplch

   Draws a string in the plane of the reference parallelogram (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdplch (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                xpos    [1] : float,
                ypos    [1] : float,
                chrs    [1] : string,
                size    [1] : float,
                angle   [1] : float,
                counter [1] : float
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier for where you want to draw the surface. The wks identifier is one returned either from
   calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   xpos
   ypos

   Input scalars specifying the parallelogram coordinates of a point relative to which the character string is to be
   positioned.
   chrs

   The string to draw.
   size

   A float scalar specifying the width of the characters to be used as a multiple of the X dimension of the reference
   parallelogram. If the reference parallelogram is not a square, distortion of the characters is to be expected: for
   example, if the reference parallelogram is twice as wide as it is high, then the same will be true of characters drawn by
   tdplch.
   angle

   A float scalar specifying the angle, in degrees, at which the character string is to be drawn relative to the reference
   parallelogram (0 => in the direction of positive X, 90 => in the direction of positive Y, 180 => in the direction of
   negative X, and so on).
   counter

   A float scalar specifying how the character string is to be centered relative to the point (xpos,ypos) within the
   reference parallelogram. If counter = -1, the leading edge of the character string will be placed at (xpos,ypos); if
   counter = 0, the center of the character string will be placed at (xpos,ypos); and if counter = +1, the trailing edge of
   the character string will be placed at (xpos,ypos). Other values may be used, with the logical results; for example, if
   counter = -.5, the point halfway between the leading edge and the center of the character string will be placed at
   (xpos,ypos).

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDPLCH for a full description of this procedure.
