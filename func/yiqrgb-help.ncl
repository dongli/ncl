yiqrgb

   Converts YIQ color values to RGB.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.0.0 and later.

Prototype

        function yiqrgb (
                yiq  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   yiq

   An array of values in the Y (luma), I (in-phase), Q (quadrature) color space. This array can be of any shape, but the
   rightmost dimension must be 3 for specifying the YIQ values.

Return value

   The returned value is an array of the same dimension and dimension sizes as the input array. The input YIQ values will
   have been replaced with their Red, Green, Blue (RGB) equivalents. If any values in the input array are double precision,
   the returned array will be double precision.

Description

   This function determines the RGB equivalents to YIQ color values.

   The YIQ color model is used in U.S. commercial analog television and is a recoding of RGB for transmission efficeincy.

   The Y component (luma) is the only component used by black and white TVs. Y minimizes the effect of two colors appearing
   different to the human eye but mapping to similar monochrome intensities. Y values range between 0. and 1. inclusive.

   The I (in-phase) component is in the range [-0.6, 0.6]. It attains its maximum when the input RGB triple is (1.,0.,0.);
   it attains its minimum when the input RGB triple is (0.,1.,1.) .

   The Q (quadrature) component is in the range [-0.53, 0.53]. Q attains its maximum when the input RGB triple is (1.,0.,1.)
   and it attains its minimum when the input triple is (0.,1.,0.).

   The returned Red, Green, and Blue values will be in the range [0.,1.].

Examples

   Example 1

   The following:
begin
  rgb = yiqrgb((/ 0.2988923,  0.5960701,  0.2113775 /))
  print(rgb)
end

   produces:

   Example 2

   The following:
begin
  yiq = (/ (/ 0.2988923,  0.5960701,  0.2113775 /),    \
           (/ 0.5870147, -0.2743084, -0.5229885 /)  /)
  rgb = yiqrgb(yiq)
  print(rgb)
