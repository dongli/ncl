gsn_polymarker_ndc

   Draws polymarkers on the given workstation.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_polymarker_ndc (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                x       : numeric,
                y       : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   x
   y

   Multi-dimensional arrays of the same length containing the X and Y coordinates of the polymarkers, which must be
   normalized device coordinates (NDC).

   res

   A variable containing an optional list of polymarker resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the
   attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the
   resources applied.

Description

   If a missing value is encountered in x and/or y, then this pair is ignored, and no polymarker will be drawn at that pair.

   There are many marker styles available, and you can use the gsMarkerIndex resource to change the marker style. The
   default is an asterisk. You can also create your own marker style using the NhlNewMarker function.

  gsres = True              ; Indicate you want to set some resources.
  gsres@gsMarkerColor = 3   ; Change marker color.
  gsres@gsMarkerSizeF = 10. ; Increase marker size by a factor of 10.

  gsn_polymarker_ndc(wks,markx,marky,gsres)  ; Draw the polymarkers.

  gsres@gsMarkerColor = 18   ; Change marker color.
  gsres@gsMarkerIndex = 16   ; Change marker type to a filled circle.

  gsn_polymarker_ndc(wks,markx+.4,marky-.4,gsres) ; Draw the polymarkers.

  frame(wks)  ; Advance the frame.
