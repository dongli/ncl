str_join

   Joins all strings into one string, with each string separated by delimiter.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function str_join (
                string_val  : string,
                delim   [1] : string
        )

        return_val [1] :  string

Arguments

   string_val

   A string array of any dimensionality.
   delim

   The string delimiter to use between each joined string.

Description

   This function returns a string with all input strings joined together, separated by the given delim delimiter.

   If any of the strings are missing, then the missing value string will be included in the concatenation. It's up to the
   user to remove missing strings if this behavior is not desired (see example below).

Examples

   Example 1

 strs = (/"NCL", "has", "many", "features", "common", "to", "modern", "programming", "languages."/)
 new_str = str_join(strs, " ")
 print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCL has many features common to modern programming languages.

   Example 2

   See what happens when you have missing value strings:
  strs = (/"NCL","has","many","features","missing","common","to", \
           "missing","modern","programming","languages.","missing"/)
  strs@_FillValue = "missing"

  new_str = str_join(strs, " ")
  print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCL has many features missing common to missing modern programming languages. missing

   If this behavior is not desired, then you need to remove the missing strings:
  strs2 = strs(ind(.not.ismissing(strs)))
  new_str = str_join(strs2," ")
  print(new_str)

   Output

(0)     NCL has many features common to modern programming languages.
