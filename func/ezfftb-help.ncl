ezfftb

   Perform a Fourier synthesis from real and imaginary coefficients.

Prototype

        function ezfftb (
                cf    : numeric,
                xbar  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   cf

   Fourier coefficients as created by ezfftf. The elements cf(0,...) are the real coefficients, and cf(1,...) are the
   imaginary coefficients.
   xbar

   The constant fourier coefficient. This must be a scalar or a single vector of the length of the product of the leftmost
   dimensions of x).

Return value

   A double array is returned if the input cf is double, otherwise a float array is returned.

   If cf(2,kcoef), then ezfftb will construct a one dimensional series using the coefficients and the value of xbar. The
   length of the one dimensional series may be odd or even depending upon the input coefficients. If cf(2,N,kcoef), where N
   refers to one or more dimensions and xbar(N) then ezfftb will construct a variable, say x, that that is of size x(N).

   The example will clarify.

Description

   There's a bug in V6.1.2 and earlier of this function in which if "npts" is odd, the wrong values are returned. This is
   fixed in V6.2.0.

   Given Fourier coefficients cf and the series means(s) xbar, ezfftb computes the periodic sequences and returns an array
   of length N x cf@npts.

   If any missing values are encountered in one of the input arrays, then no calculations will be performed on that array,
   and the corresponding output array will be filled with missing values.

   Use ezfftb_n if the dimension to do the transform across is not the rightmost dimension. This function can be
   significantly faster than ezfftb.

Examples

   Example 1

   The first example associated with ezfftf performed a fourier analysis on a series of 24 values. It produced the real and
   imaginary coef. The following inputs (slightly truncated) coefficients to (approximately) reconstruct the series. Of
   course, if the full coefficients had been directly input the original values would be reproduced.
    cReal = (/1.34, -13.48, 2.17, 3.29, -5.40, 0.08, \   ; real coef
             -2.72,   2.70, 2.17,-0.35,  2.95,-1.79 /)
    cImag = (/3.73,   6.89, 3.36, 0.36,  3.02, 1.00, \   ; imag coef
              4.11,   1.52, 2.53,-2.64,  2.81, 0.00 /)

    cf    = (/ (/ cReal /) , (/ cImag /) /)              ; (2,12)
    xbar  = 1011.04                                      ; mean

    x     = ezfftb(cf, xbar)          ; fourier synthesis
    print(x)

   Example 2

   In some instances, it may be appropriate to construct a series about a different mean (commonly, 0.0). The following is
   the same as Example 1 but reconstruct the series about a mean of 0.0
    X     = ezfftb(cf, 0.0)          ; fourier synthesis

   Here X would be a one dimensional array containing:
   (/ -9.04,  5.96,  6.96, 8.95,  6.95, 15.94, \
      16.95, 18.96,  0.95, 0.94,-29.03,  0.95, \
     -10.06,-15.02,-16.02,-0.05, 15.98, 13.96, \
      18.95,  4.96,-15.04,-5.04, -9.02,-29.03  /)

   Example 3

   Let x(ntim,klvl,nlat,mlon) and N corresponds to (ntim,klvl,nlat) in this instance, and mlon is a number of longitude
   points:
    cf = ezfftf (x)       ; ==> cf(2,ntim,klvl,nlat,mlon/2)
                          ; ==> cf@npts = mlon
                          ; ==> cf@xbar ==> contains the means
                                            length=ntim*klvl*nlat

   Reconstruct using only wave 3 and set all the means to 0.0:
  cf(:,:,:,:,0:1) = 0.0         ; waves 1 and 2 set to zero
  cf(:,:,:,:,3:mlon-1) = 0.0    ; waves >3      set to zero

   Here cf@xbar will be a one-dimensional array of length ntim*klvl*nlat. We want set all to 0.0 so this is readily done
   via:

  cf@xbar = 0.0
  xWave_3 = ezfftb (cf, cf@xbar)
