   Plots a basic wind rose.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/wind_rose.ncl"

        function WindRoseBasic (
                wks        : graphic,
                wspd       : numeric,
                wdir       : numeric,
                numPetals  : integer,
                circFr     : float,
                res        : graphic
        )

        return_val  :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   wspd

   A one-dimensional array of wind speeds (any units).
   wdir

   A one-dimensional array of wind direction (degrees). The wind directions are meteorological; that is, 90 degrees means
   blowing from the east; 180 means winds blowing from the south.
   numPetals

   Number of wind rose directions.
   circFr

   Intervals at which frequency circles are drawn.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied. The most common resource is to set the figure title via tiMainString.

Return value

   A plot identifier of the wind rose is returned.

Description

   This function creates a basic wind rose (i.e. a frequency of wind direction plus average speed).
