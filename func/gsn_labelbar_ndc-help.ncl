gsn_labelbar_ndc

   Draws a labelbar on the given workstation.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_labelbar_ndc (
                wks    [1] : graphic,
                nboxes [1] : integer,
                labels [*] : string,
                x      [1] : numeric,
                y      [1] : numeric,
                res    [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   nboxes

   The number of labelbar boxes you want.
   labels

   An array of strings containing the labelbar labels.
   x
   y

   The X and Y coordinates of the upper left corner of the labelbar, which must be normalized device coordinates (NDC).
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of labelbar resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the
   attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the
   resources applied.

Description

   This procedure draws a labelbar on the given workstation, given the number of boxes and labels for each item. It is
   possible to have a different number of labels than you do boxes, depending on how you label the boxes (by the box
   centers, box exterior edges, or box interior edges).

   This procedure is similar to the function gsn_create_labelbar, except it doesn't return the labelbar id. The labelbar id
   can be useful if you want to use gsn_add_annotation to attach the labelbar to a plot.
