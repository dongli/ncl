kf_filter

   Extract equatorial waves by filtering in the Wheeler-Kiladis wavenumber-frequency domain.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/contrib/kf_filter.ncl"

        function kf_filter (
                x      [*][*] : numeric,
                obsPerDay [1] : integer,
                tMin      [1] : numeric,
                tMax      [1] : numeric,
                kMin      [1] : numeric,
                kMax      [1] : numeric,
                hMin      [1] : numeric,
                hMax      [1] : numeric,
                waveName  [1] : string
        )

Arguments

   x

   Data to be filtered. Time should be the left dimension and longitude should be the right dimension. For example:
   x(time,lon).
   obsPerDay

   Number of time steps per 24 hour period.
   tMin
   tMax

   Range of cut-off periods (must be positive).
   kMin
   kMax

   Range of wavenumbers, can be positive (eastward) or negative (westward).
   hMin
   hMax

   Range of equivalent depths to use.
   waveName

   Name of dispersion curve to use. The following names are recognized: "ER", "Kelvin", "MRG", "IG0", "IG1", "IG2" (IG0 and
   MRG are same). Specifically:
    1. ER: Equatorial Rossby Wave
    2. Kelvin: Kelvin Wave
    3. MRG: Mixed Rossby-Gravity
    4. IGO: Inertia-Gravity [n=0]
    5. IG1: Inertia-Gravity [n=1]
    6. IG2: Inertia-Gravity [n=2]

Return value

   return_val [dimsizes(x)] : float or double

Description

   At each point, the data are space-time bandpass filtered following Wheeler and Kiladis (1999). The data are first
   detrended and tapered in time, and then they are filtered using 2-dimensional FFT (fft2df, fft2db). The filter bounds can
   simply be rectangular (as in Wheeler and Kiladis's MJO filter), or they can bounded by the dispersion curves of the
   shallow water equatorial waves. At this time, other filter shapes (e.g., the TD filter from Kiladis et al. 2006) are not
   supported.

   The input data should be periodic (global) in longitude. In addition, filtered anomalies near the temporal ends of the
   dataset should generally be ignored. The longer the periods filtered for, the more data should be ignored at the ends.
