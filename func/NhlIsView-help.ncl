NhlIsView

   Returns True for each given object that is a View object.

Prototype

        function NhlIsView (
                objects  : graphic
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(objects)] :  logical

Arguments

   objects

   An array of one or more instances of NCL objects. NCL objects are created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by
   calling the NCL create language construct.

Return value

   This function returns a logical array with the same dimensions as the input argument objects.

Description

   For each object identifier in the objects array, the value True is returned if the object is a View object, and False
   otherwise. If any of the input values is an invalid object, then a missing value is returned for that element.

   View objects are basically objects that you can draw, like a contour plot, an XY plot, a map, a text string, or a
   labelbar. View objects can be created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by calling the NCL create language
   construct.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example creates various NCL objects using both gsn functions, and by calling the NCL create language construct to
   create a text string.
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
;
; Create workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

;
; Create a data object.
;
  npts = 500
  x    = fspan(0,npts-1,npts)
  y    = 500.+ 0.9 * x * sin(0.031415926535898*x)
  xy   = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,False)

;
; Use the "create" construct to create a text string.
;
 text = create "text1" textItemClass wks
    "txString"      : "This is a string"
    "txPosYF"       : 0.5
    "txPosYF"       : 0.9
  end create

  map = gsn_map(wks,"LambertConformal",False)

  print(NhlIsView((/wks,xy,map,text/)))   ; Should be (/False,True,True,True/)
