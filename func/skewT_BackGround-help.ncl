skewT_BackGround

   Creates a background chart for Skew T, Log P plotting.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/skewt_func.ncl"

        function skewT_BackGround (
                wks  : graphic,
                res  : graphic
        )

        return_val  :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A plot identifier of the Skew T background chart created is returned.

Description

   This function creates a Skew T background in conformance with the weather prediction chart (WPC) described in DOD-WPC
   9-16-1. For an overview of the information on a Skew T chart, see:

     http://twister.sbs.ohio-state.edu/helpdocs/skew_T_help.html

   skewT_BackGround takes a workstation ID and a resource list as arguments. By default skewT_BackGround produces no
   graphical output; it sets the special resources gsnDraw and gsnFrame to False. The user must use the draw procedure to
   render the background and invoke the frame procedure to advance the plot.

   The primary use of this procedure is to create a background for use with skewT_PlotData.

   Note: in versions NCL 6.1.0 and later, the colors produced by this function may appear slightly different. This is
   because the code is using named colors to draw certain elements, like "PaleGreen" for the background, and "Tan" for the
   lines. In NCL 6.1.0, named colors no longer need to be added to a color map in order to be recognized, so you will start
   to see the correct colors in this release. If you don't like these colors, you can restore the old ones by setting the
   "UseMyColorMap" resource to True. You may also need to set the color map to "default":

   gsn_define_colormap(wks,"default")

   There are a number of resources the user can set to alter the default Skew T background. For more information about how
   to use these resources, see the examples section below.

   Resource name      Default value
   DrawIsotherm       True
   DrawIsobar         True
   DrawMixRatio       True
   DrawDryAdiabat     True
   DrawMoistAdiabat   True (aka: saturation or pseudo adiabat)
   DrawWind           True
   DrawStandardAtm    True
   DrawColLine        True
   DrawColAreaFill    False
   DrawFahrenheit     True (Fahrenheit "x" axis)
   DrawHeightScale    False
   DrawHeightScaleFt  True (default is feet [otherwise km])
   DrawStandardAtmThk 2.0
   UseMyColorMap      False
   PrintOpts          False
   Font               "helvetica"
