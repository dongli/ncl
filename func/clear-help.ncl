clear

   Clears the given workstation objects.

Prototype

        procedure clear (
                wks  : graphic
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An array of any dimensionality of NCL Workstation identifiers. The identifiers are ones returned either from calling
   gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

Description

   This procedure loops through the given list of workstation identifiers and clears the workstation. If any of the
   workstations were set up to pause on the clear procedure, they must have a button click or key click in them before the
   actual clearing occurs.

Examples

   Run this script and see how the use of "clear" affects whether the two XY plots get drawn on the same window.

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
  x = (/10.,20.,30.,40.,50.,60.,70.,80.,90./)
  y = (/0.,0.71,1.,0.7,0.002,-0.71,-1.,-0.71,-0.003/)

  wtype = "x11"
  wks = gsn_open_wks(wtype,"clear_example")

  res             = True
  res@gsnMaximize = False
  res@gsnFrame    = False    ; Must be set False, otherwise a new
                             ; X11 window will be created.

  plot = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,res)

  clear(wks)    ; If "wtype" is "ps", this behaves like a page advance

  y2 = (/(/0., 0.7, 1., 0.7, 0., -0.7, -1., -0.7, 0./),\
        (/2., 2.7, 3., 2.7, 2.,  1.3,  1.,  1.3, 2./),\
        (/4., 4.7, 5., 4.7, 4.,  3.3,  3.,  3.3, 4./)/)

  plot = gsn_xy(wks,x,y2,res)

  frame(wks)
end
