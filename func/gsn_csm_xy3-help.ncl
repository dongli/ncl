gsn_csm_xy3

   Creates and draws an XY plot with three different Y axes.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_xy3 (
                wks    : graphic,
                x      : numeric,
                yL     : numeric,
                yR     : numeric,
                yR2    : numeric,
                resL   : logical,
                resR   : logical,
                resR2  : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   x

   The X coordinates of all three Y curves.
   yL
   yR
   yR2

   The Y coordinates of each curve. The yL curve will be represented on the left axis, the yR curve will be represented on
   the right axis, and the yR2 curve will be represented by a single vertical line to the right of the right Y axis.
   resL
   resR
   resR2

   Variables containing optional lists of plot resources for the three curves, where the resources are attached as
   attributes. Set to True if you want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any
   resources to set, or you don't want the resources applied.

   For setting resources that don't particularly apply to a specific plot, like frame maximization (gsnMaximize), a main
   title (tiMainString), or the three subtitles at the top (gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, gsnRightString), you should set
   these resources with resL, and not resR or resR2.

   The resR and resR2 resources should only be resources that apply specifically to the curve they represent.

Return value

   The return value is the scalar id of the first XY plot created.

   The scalar id of the second and third XY plot is returned as attributes called "xy2" and "xy3". These attributes or the
   return value can be used in calls to functions like gsn_add_polymarker or gsn_add_polyline to add primitives to any three
   plots.

   The id of the data object is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change
   some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws an XY plot on the given workstation, with three different Y axes represented. The plot id
   returned is the one that represents the left Y axis. The other plots are returned as attributes called "xy2" and "xy3".

   As with a regular XY plot, NCL will try to pick "nice" values for the Y axes. This means that your Y axes may not line up
   as expected. To control the Y axes so that the min/max of each has the min/max of your actual data, set the trYMinF and
   trYMaxF resources. For example:

  resL@trYMinF = min(yL)
  resL@trYMaxF = max(yL)
  resR@trYMinF = min(yR)
  resR@trYMaxF = max(yR)
  resR2@trYMinF = min(yR2)
  resR2@trYMaxF = max(yR2)

   If any of x, yL, yR, or yR2 has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   If you want to create legends for your series of plots, the best thing to do is use gsn_create_legend. This allows you to
   create a legend with any labels you want, and then attach it to any part of the main plot. See the third frame of XY
   example 19.
