v5d_setLowLev

   Sets the lowest vertical offset, in grid level, for each 3-dimensional gridded variable in a Vis5D+ format file.

Prototype

        procedure v5d_setLowLev (
                lowLev [*] : integer
        )

Arguments

   lowLev

   An array of integers of size numvars

lowLev(1) = offset for first variable
lowLev(2) = offset for second variable
...
lowLev(numvars-1) = offset for last variable

Description

   v5d_setLowLev()
   sets a lowest vertical offset, in grid level, for each data variable in a 3D gridded dataset.

   By default, the bottom-most grid level of each variable is displayed at the bottom of the 3D box; each grid extends
   upward for however many levels are present. Sometimes, however, the bottom-most grid level of a particular variable is
   best positioned higher up in the grid. An example of this might be a combined ocean/atmosphere dataset. There may be a
   total of 18 grid levels, the bottom 8 grid levels being ocean data and the top 10 grid levels being atmospheric data. In
   this case, the bottom of the atmospheric data is best offset, or shifted upward, by 8 grid levels.

   Elaborating on the ocean/atmosphere example, suppose we have two ocean variables named S (salinity) and T[o] (ocean
   temperature), and two atmosphere variables named P (pressure) and T[a] (atmospheric temperature). Further suppose there
   are 8 layers of ocean data and 10 layers of atmospheric data. Below is a summary showing how the v5d_setLowLev()
   function can address this situation:

varnum  varname(varnum)     nl(varnum)  lowlev(varnum)
  1            S                 8            0
  2            To                8            0
  3            P                10            8
  4            Ta               10            8

   v5d_setLowLev()
   may be called at any point between v5d_create and v5d_write().
