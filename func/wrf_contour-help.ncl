wrf_contour

   Creates a contour plot from ARW WRF model output.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

        function wrf_contour (
                nc_file     : file,
                wks         : graphic,
                data [*][*] : numeric,
                res         : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   nc_file

   Reference to an input netCDF file opened with addfile.
   wks

   An NCL Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to
   create a Workstation object.
   data

   A two-dimensional array to be contoured.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. See description section below for more
   information.

Return value

   A scalar id of the plot created is returned.

Description

   This function creates contour plot (but does not draw it). To draw the plot, see the example below.

   If data has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   If data has a "description" attribute, this value will be used in the plot title.

   This function recognizes some special resources that can be attached as attributes to res:

     * ContourParameters - this resource can either be a scalar that represents the contour level spacing, or it can be an
       array of three elements that represent the minimum level, the maximum level, and the level spacing. This resource is
       not recognized by any of the gsn_xxxx plotting routines.
     * gsnContourZeroLineThicknessF - sets the thickness of the zero contour line. The default for this routine is 2.0 (when
       using any of the gsn_xxx routines, the default is 1.0)
     * gsnContourNegLineDashPattern - sets the line style of the zero contour line. The default for this routine is 1, which
       is a dashed line (see the dash pattern table for more options). When using any of the gsn_xxx routines, the default
       is 0 (a solid line).
     * FieldTitle - This becomes the main title of the vector plot. If not set, then the "description" attribute of the
       data_u variable will be used, if available.
       This also becomes part of the "information label" on the contour plot.
     * SubFieldTitle - if set, this will be appended to the FieldTitle title with a space between the two.
     * UnitLabel - if set, this will be appended to the existing FieldTitle title in parentheses. If not set, the "units"
       attribute of the data_u variable will be used, if available.
     * PlotLevelID - if set, this will be appended to the existing FieldTitle title with an " at " between the two. If not
       set, the "PlotLeveID" attribute of the data_u variable will be used, if available.

   The final main title could look something like "FieldTitle SubFieldTitle (UnitLabel) at PlotLevelID".

   To make the labelbar vertical instead of horizontal, set these two resources:
res@lbOrientation = "vertical"
res@pmLabelBarSide = "right"

   wrf_contour is part of a library of functions and procedures in WRFUserARW.ncl written to help users plot ARW WRF model
   data.

   WRF-related questions should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

  ter = wrf_user_getvar(a,"HGT",0)   ; Get terrain height for time 0

  res = True
  res@cnFillOn  = True
  res@gsnDraw   = True    ; Forces the plot to be drawn
  res@gsnFrame  = True    ; Frame advance
  contour = wrf_contour(a,wks,ter,res)
