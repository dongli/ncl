echo_on

   Enables echoing of NCL statements as they are encountered.

Prototype

        procedure echo_on (
        )

Description

   Echoes NCL statements as they are encountered. This can be particularly useful when debugging NCL scripts in batch mode.
   This procedure has the same effect as the command line option -x and is useful in conjunction with echo_off.

  end if

end
