gsn_attach_plots

   Attaches a series of plots to a base plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_attach_plots (
                base_plot [1] : graphic,
                plots     [*] : graphic,
                res_base      : logical,
                res_plots     : logical
        )

        return_val [*] :  graphic

Arguments

   base_plot

   A plot identifier created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by calling create to create a View object.
   plots

   An array of plot identifiers (see description for base_plot). These are the plots that will be attached to the base_plot
   via one of its axes.
   res_base

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources to apply to base_plot, attached as attributes. Set to True if
   you want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't
   want the resources applied.
   res_plots

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources to apply to plots, attached as attributes. Set to True if you
   want the attached attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want
   the resources applied.

Return value

   An array of ids for each attached plot will be returned. There is not really much use for this array, except that you
   could potentially use it to remove attached plots.

   The ids returned by this function are unique unique and must not be deleted. If you call this function multiple times,
   you must assign each return value to a unique variable name.

Description

   This function attaches a series of plots to a base plot, at the given axis border.

   By default, using base_plot as the first plot, this function attaches the left axis of subsequent plots to the right axis
   of the previous plot. If gsnAttachPlotsXAxis is set to True, then the top axis of the subsequent plots will be attached
   to the bottom axis of the previous plot. The tickmarks and labels where the two plots are attached will be removed.

   In addition, if gsnAttachBorderOn is set to False, the interior borders will be removed.

   base_plot will contain all of the attached plots, so if you draw base_plot, it will draw all of the attached plots as
   well.

   Important note: when you attach plots along an axis, you need to make sure that this axis of both plots covers the same
   range of values. For example, when you create a contour plot, the range of values are usually fixed. For an XY plot,
   however, NCL will try to pick nice values, and this may cause your XY plot axis to be different. To get around this, you
   can set the appropriate trXMinF/trXMaxF or trYMinF/trYMaxF resources to the actual range of the axis you are attaching
   along.

Examples

   The example below shows how to attach plots along the Y axes and the X axes:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

begin
  nplots = 6
;
; Read in some data.
;
  datadir  = "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/data/asc/"
  datafile = "u.cocos"
  data = asciiread(datadir + datafile,(/nplots,14/),"float")
;
; Open a workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","gsn_attach")

  pressure  = data(:,0)    ; First column of data is pressure (mb).
  u         = data(:,2:13) ; Rest of columns are climatological zonal winds
  xy        = new(nplots,graphic)

  xyres           = True
  xyres@vpWidthF  = 0.8
  xyres@vpHeightF = 0.4
  xyres@gsnDraw   = False
  xyres@gsnFrame  = False
  xyres@xyLineThicknessF = 2.0
;
; Create some plots.
;
  x = ispan(0,11,1)
  do i = 0,nplots-1
    xyres@tiYAxisString = "Left " + i
    xyres@tiXAxisString = "Bottom " + i
    xyres@tiMainString = "Top " + i
    xyres@xyLineColor   = i+2
    xy(i) = gsn_csm_xy(wks,x,u(i,:),xyres)
  end do

;
; Attach three plots along the X axis. You can attach the plots one
; at a time, or all at once in one call to gsn_attach_plots. In
; the code below, we are attaching them one at a time.
;
; Make sure the variable returned by gsn_attach_plots is unique
; every time.
;
  res1                     = True
  res2                     = True
  res1@gsnMaximize         = True
  res2@gsnAttachPlotsXAxis = True

  anno1 = gsn_attach_plots(xy(1),xy(2),res1,res2)
  anno2 = gsn_attach_plots(xy(0),xy(1),res1,res2)

  draw(xy(0))
  frame(wks)

;
; Attach three plots along the Y axis, using one call to gsn_attach_plots.
;
  res2@gsnAttachPlotsXAxis = False
  anno3 = gsn_attach_plots(xy(3),(/xy(4),xy(5)/),res1,res2)

  draw(xy(3))
  frame(wks)
end
