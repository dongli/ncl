linmsg

   Linearly interpolates to fill in missing values.

Prototype

        function linmsg (
                x    : numeric,
                opt  : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   An array of any dimensionality. Missing values should be indicated by x@_FillValue. If x@_FillValue is not set, then the
   NCL default appropriate to the type of x will be assumed. The fastest varying dimension (the rightmost dimension) is the
   dimension upon which the linear interpolation will be performed.
   opt

   A scalar or an array with two elements. The scalar or the first element of the array specifies how missing beginning and
   end points will be returned. If this value is greater than or equal to 0, then the beginning and end points will be
   returned as missing (most common option). If this value is less than 0, then they will be set to the nearest non-missing
   value.

   If opt has two elements, then the second value specifies the maximum number of consecutive missing values to be
   interpolated. If opt is a scalar then the routine will try to interpolate as many values as it can.

Description

   linmsg uses piecewise linear interpolation to fill in any missing values. End points which are missing on input may be
   returned as missing or set to the nearest non-missing value.

   Use linmsg_n if the dimension to do the interpolation across is not the rightmost dimension. This function can be
   significantly faster than linmsg.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example returns the interpolated values to the original one-dimensional array. (The default missing value for the
   input type will be used if no missing value is attached to the input array). The end points will be left as missing.
   Because the opt argument is a scalar, the routine will interpolate across all missing values:
begin

; Note: in Version 6.0.0, default missing will be 9.96921e+36, not -999.
 x = (/ 1190.,1455.,1550.,-999.,1745.,1770., \
        1900.,-999.,-999.,-999.,2335.,2490., \
        2720.,2710.,2530.,2900.,2760.,-999. /)

 x = linmsg(x,0)   ; endPoint= 0 missing end point(s) unaltered

end

   After interpolation, x contains:
     (/ 1190.,1455.  ,1550. ,1647.5 ,1745.,1770., \
        1900.,2008.75,2117.5,2226.25,2335.,2490., \
        2720.,2710.  ,2530. ,2900.  ,2760.,-999. /)

   Example 2

   This example returns the interpolated values to a new 1D array. The missing value has been specified by the user. The end
   points with missing values will be set to the nearest non-missing value. Because the opt argument is a scalar, the
   routine will interpolate across all missing values:
begin

 ymsg = 1.e10
 y = (/ 1115.,ymsg ,1515.,1794.,ymsg ,1710., \
        1830.,1920.,1970.,2300.,2280.,2520., \
        2630.,ymsg ,ymsg ,2800.,ymsg ,ymsg  /)
 y@_FillValue = ymsg

 ynew = linmsg(y,-1)  ; endPoint= -1 missing end point(s)
                      ;              set to nearest non-missing value
end

   After interpolation ynew contains:
     (/ 1115.,1315.,1515.,1795.,1752.,1710., \
        1830.,1920.,1970.,2300.,2280.,2520., \
        2630.,2686.67 ,2743.33 ,2800.,2800.,2800. /)

   Example 3

   Assume x is a 4-dimensional array with named dimensions "time", "lev", "lat", "lon", and sizes ntim x klev nlat x mlon.
   Assume that at random times all data are missing and x@_FillValue has been set to the missing value. Linearly interpolate
   in time to fill in the values. Use a temporary array for the interpolated values, then copy the interpolated values back
   to the original array.

   Make opt a two element array. The first element is set to 0 so that missing values at the beginning and end will be
   returned as missing. The second element is set to 5 meaning that the routine will not interpolate segments of the series
   where more than 5 consecutive values are encountered:
 opt = (/0, 5/)

 y = linmsg(x(lev|:,lat|:,lon|:,time|:), opt) ; y(klev,nlat,mlon,ntim)
                                              ; no metadata
 y!0 = "lev"
 y!1 = "lat"
 y!2 = "lon"
 y!3 = "time"
 x = (/ y(time|:,lev|:,lat|:,lon|:) /)    ; recreate the original array
                                          ; the(/ .. /) operators mean
                                          ; copy values only ... any "x"
                                          ; metadata is not destroyed.
 delete (y)

; In V5.2.0 or later, you can use linmsg_n to avoid reordering
; and reduce the above code to one line:
;  x = linmsg_n(x, opt, 0)

   Example 4

   This example is same as example 3, but uses traditional "do loops" so no rearranging of the array required. This is the
   approach used in C and Fortran codes. Be forewarned: this is extremely inefficient. NCL is an interpreted language and
   executes "do loops" very slowly. In a timing test with klev=1, nlat=64, mlon=128 and ntim=700, the following "do loop"
   approach took more than 25 minutes. However, using the (recommended) approach of example 3, the linear interpolation took
   just seconds.

   Moral: avoid do loops. See the section "Writing efficient NCL source" in the NCL reference manual.

 do kl=0,klev-1
  do nl=0,nlat-1
   do do ml=0,mlon-1
      x(:,kl,nl,ml) = linmsg(x(:,kl,nl,ml), 0)
   end do
  end do
 end do
