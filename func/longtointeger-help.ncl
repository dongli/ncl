longtointeger

   Coerces values of type long to values of type integer.

Prototype

        function longtointeger (
                long_val  : long
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(long_val)] :  integer

Arguments

   long_val

   A long variable of any dimension.

Return value

   This function returns an integer variable that has the same dimensionality as the input long variable. On most machines
   longs are the same as integers, so this function would just return its input for its output, but typed as an integer. On
   those machines where longs are actually of more precision that integers, any long that is out of range will be returned
   as a missing value.

Description

   This function converts long values to integer values.

   Any result that is out of range for an integer will be returned as a missing value.

   The function longtoint is identical to this function, and can be used if you don't want to use the full longtointeger
   name. This alias name is included just for people who don't like to type (or like the shorter names).

   This function performs coercion that is not automatically available through the NCL grammar. See the section on coercion
   of types for details on NCL's automatic type conversions.

   Attributes, with the exception of _FillValue, are not propagated by the conversion functions. See Example 2 below.
   Example 2 also illustrates how some missing values are handled.

Examples

   Example 1

   Converts an array of longs to integers.

begin
  a = (/ 0, 1, 10, 300, -1, 2147483647, 2147483649 /)
  print (longtointeger(a))
end


   Example 2

   Shows how missing values are handled.

begin
;
;  Conversion does not preserve attributes, except missing value.
;
  a = new(3,long)
  a = (/ 66, 67, 68/)
  a@T = "string"
  a@_FillValue = 65
  b = longtointeger(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has no missing value
;  specified and the original variable does, the missing
;  value of the target variable inherits the missing value of the
;  original variable and the missing values
;  of the original variable are retained in
;  the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,long)
  a = (/ 66, 67, 65/)
  a@_FillValue = 65
  b = longtointeger(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has a missing
;  value specified and the original variable
;  has a missing value specified, the missing
;  value of the target variable is retained
;  even when the missing value of the original
;  variable is in the range of the type of the
;  target variable.  Missing values in the
;  original variable are converted to the
;  missing value of the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,long)
  a = (/ 66, 67, 65/)
  a@_FillValue = 65
  b = new(3,long,68)
  b = longtointeger(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
end
