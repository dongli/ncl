gsn_blank_plot

   Draws a blank plot with tickmarks pointing inward.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_blank_plot (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the plot created is returned. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some plot options
   after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a blank plot with tickmarks pointing inward. By default, the axes will go from 0.0 to
   1.0. To change this, you can set trXMinF, trXMaxF, trYMinF, and/or trYMaxF.

   If you want the tickmarks to point out, either use gsn_csm_blank_plot, or set gsnTickMarksPointOutward to True.

   You can also set any of the Tickmark resources to control their appearance.

   The frame is not automatically advanced for this function, so set gsnFrame to True if you need this. To maximize the area
   that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   This function is useful for several purposes:

     * If you need to create additional tickmarks for a plot (see example 24 on the maps only example page or example 11 on
       the tickmarks page).
     * If you need a blank canvas just for drawing primitives (polylines, polymarkers, polygons).
     * If you need to force an X or Y axis to have irregular spacing, then as of version 6.0.0, you can use this function
       and set trXCoordPoints and/or trYCoordPoints to an array of unequally-spaced values, and then overlay your existing
       plot on the blank plot to force your axis to be transformed to one with irregular-spacing (see example 30 on the XY
       plot page).

   In version 6.0.0, gsn_csm_blank_plot was added. This is very similar to gsn_blank_plot, except the tickmarks will
   automatically point outward, and you can set the special gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, and gsnLeftString resources to
   create subtitles at the top.

Examples

   For some application examples, see:
     * "tm_11.ncl" (view example)

   Here's a simple example that creates a default "blank" plot.
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","blank")

  res = True

  res@gsnMaximize = True
  res@gsnFrame    = True    ; The frame is not advanced by default.

  plot = gsn_blank_plot(wks,res)

end
