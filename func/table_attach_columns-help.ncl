table_attach_columns

   Attaches [appends] additional columns to a previously existing two-dimensional array.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.2.0.a034 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function table_attach_columns (
                t1      : [*][*],
                t2      : [*][*],
                opt [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [*][*]

Arguments

   t1

   A two-dimensional array of any type.
   t2

   A two-dimensional array of the same type as t1. The left dimension size [rows] must be identical to that of t1.
   opt

   An integer. Set to 0. Currently, not used.

Return value

   A two-dimensional array. The left dimension will be the same as on input. The right dimension will have additional
   columns appended to the t1 table.

Description

   This function uses dimension reordering. This requires that the variables have named dimensions. It is not required that
   the dimensions of t1 and t2 be named upon entry. If not present, the function will provide temporary named dimensions.

Examples

   Example 1

   Consider the two dimensional arrays y1 and y2. It is desired to append y2 to the y1 array and return a new array.

                                       ; y1 is 5X3
   y1 = (/(/-3.04, -2.05, -4.29/),\
          (/-2.07, -3.66, -1.46/),\
          (/-2.49, -3.11, -3.83/),\
          (/-4.44, -3.24, -3.08/),\
          (/-2.14, -4.68, -2.01/)/)

                                      ; y2 is 5X5
   y2 = (/(/153.50, 167.58, 115.26, 143.38, 154.57/),\
          (/190.60, 138.17, 113.66, 172.26, 150.34/),\
          (/150.35, 189.73, 146.19, 159.03, 188.25/),\
          (/148.74, 176.38, 100.36, 155.45, 196.51/),\
          (/188.72, 122.79, 176.24, 117.69, 174.37/)/)

   y1!0 = "row"   ; explicitly name dimensions
   y1!1 = "col"
   y2!0 = "row"
   y2!1 = "col"
                                      ; b is 5X8
   b = table_attach_columns(y1, y2, 0)

   ncol = 3 + 5
   write_matrix( b, ncol+"f8.2", False)

   will yield [b]
