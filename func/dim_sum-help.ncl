dim_sum

   Computes the arithmetic sum of a variable's rightmost dimension at all other dimensions.

Prototype

        function dim_sum (
                x  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality is the same as the first n-2 dimensions of the input variable. That is, the dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   The dim_sum function computes the sum of all elements of the n-1th (rightmost) dimension for each index of the dimensions
   0...n-2. Missing values are ignored.

   Use dim_sum_n if you want to specify which dimension(s) to calculate the sum on.

   Use dim_sum_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

   dim_sum_Wrap , dim_sum_n_Wrap , sum, dim_sum_n, dim_median, dim_stddev, dim_num, dim_product, dim_rmsd, dim_rmvmean,
   dim_rmvmed, dim_standardize, dim_stat4, dim_stddev, dim_variance

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable, q, of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the sum of the rightmost dimension.
    q   = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qav = dim_sum(q)   ;==>  qav(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let x be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the zonal sum (i.e., sum of all non-missing longitudes) is:
    xSumLon = dim_sum( x )    ; ==> xSumLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_sum_Wrap function:

    xSumLon = dim_sum_Wrap( x )    ; ==> xSumLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let x be defined as in Example 2: x(time,lat,lon). Compute the sum over time at each latitude/longitude grid point. Use
   NCL's Named Subscripting to reorder the input array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension.

   Note: in V5.1.1, you will be able to use dim_sum_n to avoid having to reorder your data.

    xSumTime = dim_sum( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xSumTime(nlat,nlon)
    xSumTime = dim_sum_n( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed

   If metadata is desired use
    xSumTime = dim_sum_Wrap( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xSumTime(lat,lon)
    xSumTime = dim_sum_n_Wrap( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed
