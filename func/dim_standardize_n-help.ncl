dim_standardize_n

   Calculates standardized anomalies of the given dimension(s) at all other dimensions.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function dim_standardize_n (
                x        : numeric,
                opt      : integer,
                dims [*] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   opt

   Setting opt=1 means to use the population standard deviation (i.e., divide by the number of non-missing value [N]).
   Otherwise, the sample standard deviation is used for normalization (i.e., divide by [N-1]).
   dims

   The dimension(s) of x on which to calculate the standardized anomalies. Must be consecutive and monotonically increasing.

Return value

   The output will be of type double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

   The dimensionality will be the same as the input dimensionality.

Description

   The dim_standardize_n function calculates and removes the mean from all elements of the dimensions indicated by dims. It
   then standardizes at these dimensions by dividing the resulting deviations from the mean by the standard deviation of the
   given dimensions. These values are often called standardized anomalies. This is repeated for each index of the remaining
   dimensions. Missing values are ignored.

   Use dim_standardize_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

   dim_standardize_n_Wrap, dim_median, dim_stddev, dim_num, dim_product, dim_rmsd, dim_rmvmean, dim_rmvmed, dim_standardize,
   dim_stat4, dim_stddev, dim_sum, dim_variance

Examples

   Example 1: Let x be a 1-dimensional array: (a) Create a new variable, xNew, that contains standardized values; (b)
   replace the variable x with the standardized values. Use the population standard deviation.

  xNew = dim_standardize_n(x, 1, 0)  ; new variable
  x    = dim_standardize_n(x, 1, 0)  ; Or, overwrite with deviations

   Note: when operating across the rightmost dimension, it is simpler to use dim_standardize.

   Example 2: Let x be a 3-dimensional array with dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon). Standardize values of the the
   rightmost (here, "nlon") dimension. Use the sample standard deviation.

   xLon = dim_standardize_n (x,0,2)        ; new variable
   xLon = dim_standardize_n_Wrap(x,0,2)    ; with metadata
   x    = dim_standardize_n (x,0,2)        ; overwrite with deviations

   Example 3: Let x be a 3-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlat, nlon).
   Standardize the values of the time dimension at all lat/lon indices:

   xTime = dim_standardize_n(x, 0, 0)
   xTime = dim_standardize_n_Wrap(x, 0, 0) ; with metadata

   Example 4: Let x be a 4-dimensional array with named dimensions (time, lev, lat, lon) and dimension sizes (ntim, nlev,
   nlat, nlon). Standardize the values of the time and level dimension at all lat/lon indices:

   xstd = dim_standardize_n(x, 0, (/0,1/))
   xstd = dim_standardize_n_Wrap(x, 0, (/0,1/)) ; with metadata

   Example 5: Let x be as in Example 3 and let x contain monthly means for (say) 10 years of data (ntim=120). Standardized
   monthly anomalies for each month could be calculated using array subscripting (opt=0 or 1)

   xJan  = dim_standardize_n(x(0:ntim-1:12,:,:), opt, 0)
   xJuly = dim_standardize_n(x(6:ntim-1:12,:,:), opt, 0)
