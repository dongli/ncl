wrf_smooth_2d

   Smooths a given field.

Prototype

        procedure wrf_smooth_2d (
                fld   : numeric,
                iter  : integer
        )

Arguments

   fld

   Field to smooth. Must contain at least two dimensions. As of V5.1.0, this array will be searched for missing values, and
   no smoothing will be done on these values.

   iter

   Number of smoothing passes to apply to the field.

Description

   This procedure operates directly on fld and smooths it using a nine point average. This code is from the original
   "filter2d" routine in the WRF "wrf_user_fortran_util_0.f" Fortran file.

   As of V5.1.0, if there are any missing values in fld, no smoothing will be done on these values.

   Prior to V5.1.0, this function will take the missing data as regular values, so you must confirm that the input variable
   has no missing data. You can do this either statement:
  print(ismissing(fld))

  print(any(ismissing(fld)))

   Questions on this function should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

  nc_file=addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  T  = nc_file->T(time,:,:,:)
  th = T + 300.

  P  = nc_file->P(time,:,:,:)
  PB = nc_file->PB(time,:,:,:)
  p  = ( P + PB )

  tk = wrf_tk( p , th )

  QVAPOR = nc_file->QVAPOR(time,:,:,:)
  PH     = nc_file->PH(time,:,:,:)
  PHB    = nc_file->PHB(time,:,:,:)
  var    = ( PH + PHB ) / 9.81
  dim    = dimsizes(var)
  z      = 0.5 * ( var(0:dim(0)-2,:,:) + var(1:dim(0)-1,:,:) )

 ; Sea level pressure [hPa]
  slp   = wrf_slp( z, tk, p, QVAPOR )

 ; Smooth SLP
  wrf_smooth_2d(slp,3)

   Example 2

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  time = 1
  slp = wrf_user_getvar(a,"slp",time)  ; calculate SLP

  ; Smooth SLP
  wrf_smooth_2d(slp,3)
