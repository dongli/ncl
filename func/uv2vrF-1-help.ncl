uv2vrF

   Computes the vorticity via spherical harmonics, given the u and v wind components on a fixed grid.

Prototype

        function uv2vrF (
                u  : numeric,
                v  : numeric
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(u)] :  float or double

Arguments

   u
   v

   wind components (input, arrays with two or more dimensions, last two dimensions must be nlat x nlon)
     * input values must be in ascending latitude order
     * input array must be on a global grid

Return value

   A double array is returned if u or v are double; a float array is returned otherwise. The returned array will be of
   dimension size dimsizes (u).

Description

   Given wind components u and v, uv2vrF computes the vorticity and returns it as an array with the same dimensions as u and
   v (values will be in ascending latitude order). uv2vrF operates on a fixed grid.

   This function does not handle missing values (defined by the _FillValue attribute). If any missing values are encountered
   in a particular 2D input grid, then all of the values in the corresponding output grids will be set to the default
   missing value appropriate to the type of the output.

   Note: For the arrays whose last two dimensions are nlat x nlon, the rest of the dimensions (if any) are collectively
   referred to as N. If the input/output arrays are just two dimensions, then N can either be considered equal to 1 or
   nothing at all.

   Arrays which have dimensions N x nlat x nlon should not include the cyclic (wraparound) points when invoking the
   procedures and functions which use spherical harmonics (Spherepack).

   Use uv2vrF_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

   If the input arrays u and v are on a gaussian grid, uv2vrG should be used. Also, note that uv2vrF is the function version
   of uv2vrf.

   Note, if the input arrays are not global or contain missing data, then it is recommended that uv2vr_cfd be used.

Examples

   Example 1

   Compute the vorticity given u and v on a fixed grid. Also, compute the rotational wind components.
begin
  nlat  =  73                                       ; dimensions
  mlon  = 144
  mlon1 = mlon+1
  fbfile = "uv300.hs"

  nrec  = fbinnumrec(fbfile)       ; total number of records in the file
  ntim  = nrec/2                       ; number of time steps in dataset

  uvmsg = 1e+36

  do i = 0,nrec-1,2
   month = 1                         ; january
   if (i .ge. 2) then
       month = 7                     ; july
   end if

   work = fbinrecread(fbfile,i  ,(/nlat,mlon1/),"float")
   u    = work(:,0:mlon-1)
   work = fbinrecread(fbfile,i+1,(/nlat,mlon1/),"float")
   v    = work(:,0:mlon-1)

   vr    = uv2vrF (u,v)               ; u,v ==> vorticity (rel)
   uvr   = vr2uvF (vr)                ; vr  ==> rotational wind components
  end do
end

Errors

   If jer or ker is equal to:

     1 : error in the specification of nlat
     2 : error in the specification of nlon
     4 : error in the specification of N (jer only)
