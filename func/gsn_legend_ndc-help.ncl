gsn_legend_ndc

   Draws a legend on the given workstation.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_legend_ndc (
                wks    [1] : graphic,
                nitems [1] : integer,
                labels [*] : integer,
                x      [1] : numeric,
                y      [1] : numeric,
                res    [1] : logical
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   nitems

   The number of legend items you want.
   labels

   An array of strings containing the legend labels.
   x
   y

   The X and Y coordinates of the upper left corner of the legend, which must be normalized device coordinates (NDC).
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of legend resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Description

   This procedure draws a legend on the given workstation, given the number of items and labels for each item.

   This procedure is similar to the function gsn_create_legend, except it doesn't return the legend id. The legend id can be
   useful if you want to use gsn_add_annotation to attach the legend to a plot.
