wrf_user_getvar

   Extracts data from ARW WRF model output, and does basic diagnostics calculations.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

        function wrf_user_getvar (
                file_handle  : file or list,
                variable     : string,
                time         : integer
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   file_handle

   Reference to an input netCDF file opened with addfile, or, as of V6.0.0, can be a list of NetCDF files opened with
   addfiles.
   variable

   Variable to retrieve. This can be either a variable in the ARW WRF output file(s), or a diagnostics - a limited number of
   diagnostics are available, see description below.
   time

   Time in file to retrieve. A value of -1 will retrieve all times in the file(s).

Return value

   Data of requested field.

Description

   This function extracts data from the ARW WRF file, and, if available, calculates the requested diagnostic.

   For WRF variable names and their definitions, you can easily check them by using "ncl_filedump":
  ncl_filedump wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc

   wrf_user_getvar is modifiable by the user, if you want to add your own diagnostics. To add your own diagnostics:
     * Copy the file "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl" to your own directory.
     * Edit this file with any UNIX editor and look for the lines:
undef("wrf_user_getvar")
function wrf_user_getvar( file_handle, varin[*]:string, time:integer )

       Before the final lines in this function:
  return(var)

end

       Add these lines, replacing newvar as appropriate:
  if( variable .eq. "newvar" ) then
    . . . fill in code here . . .
  end if

     * To use the new version of this function, you can do one of two things:
         1. Copy your modified script over "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl" and use the new
            "wrf_user_getvar" with your new entry:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"
xxx = wrf_usr_getvar(f,"XXX",0)

         2. Remove all but the modified "wrf_user_getvar" function from your copy, rename the function ("wrf_user_getvar2"),
            and rename the file ("my_new_script.ncl"). You will need to load the above script and your new script to use the
            new function:
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"
load "my_new_script.ncl"
xxx = wrf_usr_getvar2(f,"XXX",0)

   wrf_user_getvar is part of a library of functions and procedures in WRFUserARW.ncl written to help users plot ARW WRF
   model data.

   Questions on this function should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

   Get variables from a single WRF ARW file:

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  time = 1
  slp = wrf_user_getvar(a,"slp",time)  ; slp
  tc2 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"T2",time)   ; T2 in Kelvin
  u10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"U10",time)  ; u at 10 m
  v10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"V10",time)  ; v at 10 m

  ua  = wrf_user_getvar(a,"ua",time)   ; u on mass points
  va  = wrf_user_getvar(a,"va",time)   ; v on mass points

  avo = wrf_user_getvar(a,"avo",-1)    ; calculate avo for all times in file

   Example 2

   As of NCL V6.0.0, you can get a variable from a list of WRF ARW NetCDF files:

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  files = systemfunc("ls -1 wrfout_d01_2000*") + ".nc"
  a = addfiles(files,"r")

  slp = wrf_user_getvar(a,"slp",-1)
