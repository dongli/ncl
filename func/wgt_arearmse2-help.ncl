wgt_arearmse2

   Calculates a weighted area root-mean-square-difference (rmse) between two variables using two-dimensional weights.

Prototype

        function wgt_arearmse2 (
                q          : numeric,
                r          : numeric,
                wgt [*][*] : numeric,
                opt        : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   q

   An array of 2 or more dimensions containing the data to be differenced. The rightmost dimensions should correspond to
   "latitude" (lat) and "longitude" (lon) when dealing with quantities on a sphere ([...,],lat,lon), and "y" and "x"
   ([...,],y,x).
   r

   An array of 2 or more dimensions containing the data to be differenced. The rightmost dimensions should correspond to
   "latitude" (lat) and "longitude" (lon) when dealing with quantities on a sphere ([...,],lat,lon), and "y" and "x"
   ([...,],y,x).
   wgt

   A two-dimensional array corresponding to the rightmost dimensions of q.
   opt

   If opt = 0, the area root-mean-square-difference are calculated using available non-missing data. If opt = 1, then if any
   point in q or r is missing, the area average is not computed. In this case, it will be set to the missing value, which is
   indicated by q@_FillValue, or the default missing value if q@_FillValue is not set.

Return value

   Returns an array of the same dimensionality as the leftmost dimensions of q.

   The return type is floating point if the input is floating point, and double if the input is of type double.

Description

   This function computes the area root-mean-square-difference (rmse) between two variables using two-dimensional weights.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let q and r be (time, lev, lat, lon) global arrays with dimension sizes ktime = 120, nlev = 28, nlat = 64, mlon = 128 and
   wgt(nlat, mlon) be a 2D array containing weights for each grid point. Then
   glRmse = wgt_arearmse2(q, r, wgt, opt)   ; glRmse(ktime, nlev)

   will calculate the area (global) rmse for each time and level. glRmse will be a 2D array with dimensions (ktime, nlev) [
   = (120, 28)]. If a missing value is encountered at any of the two rightmost dimensions of q or r, it is ignored
   (equivalent to a weight of 0.0) and the average is calculated using available non-missing data (opt = 1).

   Example 2

   nhRmse = wgt_arearmse2(q(:, :, 33:nlat - 1, :), wgt(33:nlat - 1, :), 1)

   will calculate the area (northern hemisphere) rmse for each time and level. Standard subscripting is used to subset the
   input global array. nlRmse will be a 2D array with dimensions (ktime, nlev) [ = (120, 28)]. If a missing value is
   encountered at any of the two rightmost dimensions of q or r then the result will be set to _FillValue (opt = 0) for that
   particular time and level. Example 3

   shRmse = wgt_arearmse2(q(:, 5:7, {lat | -90:0}, :), wgt({lat | -90:0},: ), 0)

   will calculate the area (southern hemisphere) rmse for each time and only at levels 5, 6, 7. Named subscripting and
   standard subscripting are used to subset the input global array. shRmse will have dimensions (ktime, 3).
