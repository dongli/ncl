wrf_vector

   Creates a vector plot from ARW WRF model output.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

        function wrf_vector (
                nc_file       : file,
                wks           : graphic,
                data_u [*][*] : numeric,
                data_v [*][*] : numeric,
                res           : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   nc_file

   Reference to an input netCDF file opened with addfile.
   wks

   An NCL Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to
   create a Workstation object.
   data_u

   A two-dimensional array of the U component of the wind.
   data_v

   A two-dimensional array of the V component of the wind.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes.

Return value

   A scalar id of the plot created is returned.

Description

   This function creates a vector plot (but does not draw it). To draw the plot, see the example below.

   If data has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   If data_u has a "description" attribute, this value will be used in the plot title. (See description of "FieldTitle"
   attribute below.)

   This function recognizes some special resources that can be attached as attributes to res:

     * NumVectors - this defaults to 25. If this resource is set along with vpWidthF, then these two values will be used to
       determine values for vcMinDistanceF and vcRefLengthF (opts@vpWidthF/opts@NumVectors). Otherwise, these two resources
       will default to 0.02.
     * FieldTitle - This becomes the main title of the vector plot. If not set, then the "description" attribute of the
       data_u variable will be used, if available.
     * SubFieldTitle - if set, this will be appended to the FieldTitle title with a space between the two.
     * UnitLabel - if set, this will be appended to the existing FieldTitle title in parentheses. If not set, the "units"
       attribute of the data_u variable will be used, if available.
     * PlotLevelID - if set, this will be appended to the existing FieldTitle title with an " at " between the two. If not
       set, the "PlotLeveID" attribute of the data_u variable will be used, if available.

   The final main title could look something like "FieldTitle SubFieldTitle (UnitLabel) at PlotLevelID".

   Other vector resources are internally set by this routine:

     * vcGlyphStyle - "WindBarb"
     * vcWindBarbColor - "black"
     * vcRefAnnoOn - False (default is normally True)
     * vcMinFracLengthF - 2.0

   wrf_vector is part of a library of functions and procedures in WRFUserARW.ncl written to help users plot ARW WRF model
   data.

   WRF-related questions should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

  u10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"U10",0)   ; U component of the wind at 10m
  v10 = wrf_user_getvar(a,"V10",0)   ; V component of the wind at 10m

  res = True
  res@gsnDraw  = True    ; Forces the plot to be drawn
  res@gsnFrame = True    ; Frame advance
  vector = wrf_vector(a,wks,u10,v10,res)
