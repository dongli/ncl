tdlbls

   Draws labels for all faces of a box in 3-space (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdlbls (
                wks         [1] : graphic,
                uvwmin      [3] : float,
                uvwmax      [3] : float,
                uvwnum_lab  [3] : string,
                uvwinfo_lab [3] : string,
                edge_flag   [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier for where you want to draw the surface. The wks identifier is one returned either from
   calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   uvwmin
   uvwmax

   Float arrays of 3 elements each specifying the minimum and maximum coordinate values defining the data box in 3-space.
   uvwnum_lab

   An array of three strings containing numeric labels to be placed on a U, V, and W axis, respectively. The characters in
   the strings need not be in any particular order, but they have to be separated by blanks and each has to be readable
   using a FORTRAN format of the form "En.0", where "n" is the length of the label.
   uvwinfo_lab

   An array of three strings containing informational labels for a U, V, and W axis, respectively.
   edge_flag

   An integer scalar indicating which edges of the box are to be labelled. If zero, all six outer edges are labelled; if
   non-zero, only three edges are labelled: one set of three if negative, and a different set if positive.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDLBLS for a full description of this procedure.
