NhlIsTransform

   Returns True for each given object that is a Transform object.

Prototype

        function NhlIsTransform (
                objects  : graphic
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(objects)] :  logical

Arguments

   objects

   An array of one or more instances of NCL objects. NCL objects are created by using one of the many gsn functions, or by
   calling the NCL create language construct.

Return value

   This function returns a logical array with the same dimensions as the input argument objects.

Description

   For each object identifier in the objects array, the value True is returned if the object is a Transform object, and
   False otherwise. If any of the input values is an invalid object, then a missing value is returned for that element.

   Transform objects are objects that support the datatondc and ndctodata functions, as well as many drawing routines like
   NhlDataPolygon, gsn_polymarker, etc.

Examples

   Example 1

   This example creates various NCL objects using both gsn functions, and by calling the NCL create language construct to
   create a text string.
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
;
; Create workstation.
;
  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","test")

;
; Create a data object.
;
  npts = 500
  x    = fspan(0,npts-1,npts)
  y    = 500.+ 0.9 * x * sin(0.031415926535898*x)
  xy   = gsn_xy(wks,x,y,False)

;
; Use the "create" construct to create a text string.
;
 text = create "text1" textItemClass wks
    "txString"      : "This is a string"
    "txPosYF"       : 0.5
    "txPosYF"       : 0.9
  end create

  map = gsn_map(wks,"LambertConformal",False)

  print(NhlIsTransform((/wks,xy,map,text/)))   ; Should be (/False,True,True,False/)
