tdlbla

   Draws labels for a particular face of a box in 3-space (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        procedure tdlbla (
                wks        [1] : graphic,
                axis       [1] : integer,
                info_label [1] : string,
                num_labels [1] : string,
                xrl_edge   [2] : float,
                ybt_edge   [2] : float,
                angle      [1] : float
        )

Arguments

   wks

   An NCL workstation identifier for where you want to draw the surface. The wks identifier is one returned either from
   calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a Workstation object.

   axis

   A scalar integer indicating which edge of the face is being labelled (1 => left, 2 => right, 3 => bottom, and 4 => top,
   where the meanings of "left", "right", "bottom", and "top" are defined by the orientation of the reference
   parallelogram).
   info_label

   A string to use as an informational label. If the string is blank (""), no informational label is written.
   num_labels

   A string containing numeric labels. The labels need not be in any particular order, but they have to be separated by
   blanks and each has to be readable using a FORTRAN format of the form "En.0", where "n" is the length of the label. If
   the string is blank, no informational label is written.
   xrl_edge

   A float array of 2 elements representing values of "X" associated with the left and right edges of the face being
   labelled, where "left" and "right" are defined in terms of the current reference parallelogram.
   ybt_edge

   A float array of 2 elements representing values of "Y" associated with the bottom and top edges of the face being
   labelled, where "bottom" and "top" are defined in terms of the current reference parallelogram.
   angle

   A float scalar specifying the angle, in degrees, at which the labels are to be written. This angle is defined with
   reference to the current reference parallelogram.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Please see the documentation on TDLBLA for a full description of this procedure.
