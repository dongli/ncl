gsn_csm_streamline_map_polar

   Creates and draws a streamline plot over a polar stereographic map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_streamline_map_polar (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                u [*][*] : numeric,
                v [*][*] : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the streamline plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the maq plot created is returned. The id of the streamline plot is returned as an attribute called
   streamline, and the id of the data object is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use
   setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a streamline plot over a polar stereographic map on the given workstation. The default is
   to show only the northern hemisphere, unless the special resource gsnPolar is set to "SH".

   This function puts special longitude labels around the polar map. These labels can be controlled only through a limited
   set of gsnPolar* resources. To turn off the labels completely, set the resource gsnTickMarksOn to False.

   In order for the streamlines to be overlaid correctly on the map, please see the document "Overlaying data on a map".

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to True so that a cyclic point will be added to the data. Set this resource
   to False if your data is not cyclic, or if you have already added the cyclic point in another fashion.

   If either u or v have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   For the map, the following will happen automatically:
     * the continents will be colored gray
     * the continental outlines will be turned off
     * the longitude locations will be labeled

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

   In NCL V6.1.0, this function was updated to automatically create a labeblar if stMonoLineColor is set to False.
