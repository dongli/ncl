rm_single_dims

   Removes (squeezes) singleton (degenerate) dimensions from an array while preserving meta data.

   [new.gif] Available in version 6.1.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function rm_single_dims (
                x
        )

Arguments

   x

   An array of any shape and type.

Return value

   A scalar or a multi-dimensional array with singleton dimensions removed. If no singleton dimensions are detected the
   return array is identical to the input array.

Description

   Returns an array with the same elements as the input array, x, but with singleton dimensions removed. Coordinates
   associated with singleton dimensions are returned as attributes of the returned array. Hence, no information is lost.

   Note: This is analogous to Matlab's squeeze function.

Examples

   Example 1

   Consider an array dimensioned (2,1,5,1), specifically:

     Variable: x
     Type: float
     Total Size: 40 bytes
                 10 values
     Number of Dimensions: 4
     Dimensions and sizes:   [time | 2] x [lev | 1] x [lat | 5] x [lon | 1]
     Coordinates:
                 time: [1..2]
                 lev: [1000..1000]
                 lat: [-90..90]
                 lon: [177.5..177.5]
     Number Of Attributes: 2
       long_name :   foo
       units :       whatever

 xnew = rm_single_dims(x)
 printVarSummary(xnew)

     Variable: xnew
     Type: float
     Total Size: 40 bytes
                 10 values
     Number of Dimensions: 2
     Dimensions and sizes:   [time | 2] x [lat | 5]
     Coordinates:
                 time: [1..2]
                 lat: [-90..90]
     Number Of Attributes: 4
       lev : 1000          <== singleton coordinate added as attribute
       lon : 177.5         <== singleton coordinate added as attribute
       long_name :   foo
       units :       whatever


   NOTE: If the location of the singleton dimensions are known by the user a priori, then simple NCL indexing will result in
   exactly the same result.

 xncl = x(:,0,:,0)
 printVarSummary(xncl)      ; same as xnew above


   This is sometimes called "dimension reduction" or "rank reduction".
