gsn_csm_pres_hgt_streamline

   Creates and draws a pressure/height contour plot overlaid with streamlines.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_pres_hgt_streamline (
                wks      [1] : graphic,
                data  [*][*] : numeric,
                xcomp [*][*] : numeric,
                zcomp [*][*] : numeric,
                res      [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   data

   The two-dimensional data to contour. The leftmost dimension must contain a one-dimensional coordinate array of pressure
   values, and the values must be in the correct units. This is determined by examining the "units" attribute of the
   coordinate variable. Some accepted units are "hpa", "hPa", "Pa", "pa", "mb", "millibars", etc. If the units attribute
   doesn't exist or has the wrong value, an error will be issued.
   xcomp
   zcomp

   The data for the streamline plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the streamline plot created is returned. The id of the streamline data object is returned as an attribute
   called vfdata, and the id of the scalar data object is returned as an attribute called sfdata. If a separate contour plot
   is created, then an attribute called contour is also returned. These ids are useful if you want to use setvalues to
   change some data or plot options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a pressure/height contour plot with streamlines overlaid.

   xcomp usually refers to either the east-west (e.g. u) or north-south (e.g. v) component of the horizontal wind. If the
   plot is a pressure-longitude plot then xcomp refers to the east-west wind component (u). In this case the bottom (x-axis)
   is labeled with longitude labels (e.g. 90E) if a longitude coordinate array exists. If the plot is a pressure-latitude
   plot then xcomp refers to the north-south wind component (v). In this case the bottom (x-axis) is labeled with latitude
   labels (e.g. 30N) if a latitude coordinate array exists.

   The left Y-axis will be labeled with reverse log pressure values, and the right Y-axis with height values in km. The
   height values are a logarithmic interpolation from Standard Atmosphere of the pressure array. The pressure coordinate
   array values must lie between 1013.25 mb and 0.010 mb.

   If u, v, or data have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   If u has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the left string title.

   If u has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute is
   used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
