mixhum_ptrh

   Calculates the mixing ratio or specific humidity given pressure, temperature and relative humidity.

Prototype

        function mixhum_ptrh (
                p         : numeric,
                tk        : numeric,
                rh        : numeric,
                iswit [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(p)] :  numeric

Arguments

   p

   An array of any dimensionality equal to pressure in hPa (mb).
   tk

   An array of any dimensionality equal to temperature in K. Must be the same size as p.
   rh

   An array of any dimensionality equal to the percent relative humidity. Must be the same size as p.
   iswit

   An integer scalar that determines which variable is returned. 1 = mixing ratio (kg/kg), 2 = specific humidity (kg/kg). A
   negative value changes the units to g/kg.

Return value

   An array of same size as p. The values will be the mixing ratio or the specific humidity depending upon the value of
   iswit.

Description

   Calculates the mixing ratio or specific humidity given pressure, dew point temperature, and relative humidity. missing
   values are allowed but ignored.

   Note: a bug was fixed in V6.2.1 in which this function wasn't properly recognizing negative "iswit" values.

Examples

   Example 1

   Wallace and Hobbs [Atmospheric Science: An introductory Survey, Academic Press (p74)] state that at p=1000 [hPa], t=18
   [C] and rh=46.5 %, the specific humidity is approximately 6 [g/kg]:
  p  = 1000.           ; hPa
  tk =   18. + 273.15  ; K
  rh =   46.5          ; %

  q = mixhum_ptrh (p, tk, rh, 1) ; q = 0.006018462 (kg/kg)
  q = mixhum_ptrh (p, tk, rh,-1) ; q = 6.018462    ( g/kg)

  q = mixhum_ptrh (p, tk, rh, 2) ; q = 0.005982457 (kg/kg)
  q = mixhum_ptrh (p, tk, rh,-2) ; q = 5.982456    ( g/kg)

   Example 2

   Consider a sounding with the following values:
  p  =(/ 1008.,  \      ; hPA (mb)
         1000.,950.,900.,850.,800.,750.,700.,650.,600., \
               175.,150.,125.,100., 80., 70., 60., 50. /)

  t  =(/  29.3,  \         ; C
          28.1, 23.5, 20.9, 18.4, 15.9, 13.1, 10.1,  6.7,  3.1,\
          -0.5,-4.5,-9.0,-14.8,-21.5,-29.7,-40.0,-52.4 /)

  rh =(/  75.0, \         ;  %
          60.0, 61.1, 76.7, 90.5, 89.8, 78.3, 76.5, 46.0, 55.0, \
          63.8,53.2,42.9, 41.7, 51.0, 70.6, 50.0, 50.0 /)

; convert C to K
  w    = mixhum_ptrh (p, t+273.15,rh ,-1 ) ; mix ratio (g/kg)

   Example 3

   Let p be in units of Pa. Convert to hPa (mb)
; p*0.01 converts Pa to hPa
  w    = mixhum_ptrh (p*0.01, t ,rh, -1 ) ; mix ratio (g/kg)

   Example 4

   Let t and rh be four-dimensional of size (ntime,nlvl,nlat,nlon). Let p be a one-dimensional of size (nlvl) in units of
   hPa. Use conform to expand p to the same dimensions as t and rh. Embedding conform in the function call has the advantage
   that no temporary conformed arrays need to be created.
  q    = mixhum_ptrh(conform(t,p,1), t ,rh,-2 ) ; specific humidity (g/kg)
; q(ntim,nlvl,nlat,mlon)
