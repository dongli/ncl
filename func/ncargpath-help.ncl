ncargpath

   Returns the absolute pathnames of various NCAR Graphics directories.

Prototype

        function ncargpath (
                char  : string
        )

        return_val [1] :  string

Arguments

   char

   A singly dimensioned string denoting the directory name whose fully qualified pathname is requested.

Return value

   Returns a singly dimensioned string containing the directory name whose fully qualified pathname is requested. An invalid
   directory name returns NULL.

Examples

   Example 1

   Retrieve the NCAR Graphics bin directory, where NCAR Graphics binaries are installed:
  print(ncargpath("bin"))

   This returns a string of the form: /usr/local/ncarg/bin

   The location is site- and installation-dependent.
