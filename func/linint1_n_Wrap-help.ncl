linint1_n_Wrap

   Interpolates from one series to another using piecewise linear interpolation across the given dimension, and retains
   metadata.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function linint1_n_Wrap (
                xi           : numeric,
                fi           : numeric,
                fiCyclic [1] : logical,
                xo       [*] : numeric,
                foOption     : integer,
                dim      [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   xi

   An array that specifies the X coordinates of the fi array. It must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing,
   and can be unequally spaced. If xi is multi-dimensional, then its dimensions must be the same size as fi's dimensions. If
   it is one-dimensional, its length (call it nxi) must be the same as the dim-th dimension of fi.
   fi

   An array of one or more dimensions. The dim-th dimension (nxi) is the dimension to be interpolated. If missing values are
   present, the attribute fi@_FillValue must be set appropriately.
   fiCyclic

   An option to indicate whether the dim-th dimension of fi is cyclic.

   This should be set to True only if you have global data, but your longitude values don't quite wrap all the way around
   the globe. For example, if your longitude values go from, say, -179.75 to 179.75, or 0.5 to 359.5, then you would set
   this to True.
   xo

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the X coordinates of the return array. It must be monotonically increasing or
   decreasing and may be unequally spaced.
   foOption

   Reserved for future use. It is currently not used, but set it to 0.
   dim

   A scalar integer indicating which dimension of fi to do the interpolation across. Dimension numbering starts at 0.

Return value

   The returned value will have the same dimensions as fi, with the dim-th dimension replaced by the length of xo. The
   return type will be double if fi is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   The linint1_n_Wrap function uses piecewise linear interpolation to interpolate from one series to another, given the
   dimension to interpolate across. The series may be cyclic in the X direction.

   If missing values are present, then linint1_n_Wrap will perform the piecewise linear interpolation at all points
   possible, but will return missing values at coordinates which could not be used.

   If any of the the output coordinates xo are outside those of the input coordinates xi, the fo values at those coordinates
   will be set to missing (i.e. no extrapolation is performed).

   This function is identical to the built-in function linint1_n, except it retains metadata.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume fi is a 1D array, xi is a 1D array with values from 30 to 80 (they don't have to be equally-spaced), and that the
   rightmost dimension of fi is not to be treated as cyclic. Further assume that the output grid, xo, also has values from
   30 to 80. Then, to interpolate fi to the grid represented by xo:
  fo = linint1_n_Wrap (xi,fi, False, xo, 0, 0)

   fo will be 1D and be the same size as xo.

   Example 2

   Assume fi is dimensioned ntim x nlvl x nlat x mlon (ntim=50, nlvl=30, nlat=64, mlon=128
   ), and that the rightmost dimension is to be treated as cyclic (the user should not add a cyclic point for the rightmost
   dimension). All times, levels, and latitudes will be interpolated and returned in a new array fo, dimensioned ntim x nlvl
   x nlat x 144:

  lon = (0., 2.8125, .... , 357,0125)

  LON = (0., 2.5, ... , 357.5)    ; length 144

  fo = linint1_n_Wrap (lonfi, fi, True, LON, 0, 3)

   Example 3

   Assume xi is dimensioned ntim x nlvl x nlat x mlon (ntim=100, nlvl=30, nlat=64, mlon=128) and has named dimensions
   "time", "lev", "lat", "lon" and coordinate variables of the same name. Further, assume the values of time range from 15
   to 500.

   To create new functional values at arbitrarily specified times, the following approach could be used:
  tNew = (/15., 15.5,16.8,19.0, ...488.23 /)  ; new times
  time = xi&time   ; for clarity

  xo   = linint1_n_Wrap (time, x, False, tNew, 0, 0)

   In the above code snippet, the leftmost dimension is not to be treated as cyclic (fiCyclic=False).

   The function will interpolate all levels, latitudes and longitudes to the user-specified times and return in a new array
   xo. If NTIM = dimsizes(tNew) (number of new time steps), then the returned array, xo, will be of size NTIM x nlvl x nlat
   x mlon.
