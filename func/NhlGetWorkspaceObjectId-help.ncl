NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId

   Returns a reference to the current Workspace object.

Prototype

        function NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId (
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Description

   The Workspace object manages blocks of memory used by the NCL objects. This function returns a reference to the workspace
   object so the workspace array sizes may be configured by the user.

Examples

   The following code snippet shows how to use the NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId function to increase the maximum workspace
   memory:

  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","example")

  setvalues NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId()
    "wsMaximumSize" : 300000000
  end setvalues

   This is useful if you find yourself getting an error message from NCL that looks like this:
fatal:ContourPlotPreDraw: Workspace reallocation would exceed maximum size 100000000
fatal:ContourPlotDraw: draw error
warning:WorkstationDeactivate: workstation not active or not opened
