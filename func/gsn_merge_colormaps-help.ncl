gsn_merge_colormaps

   Merges two color maps and sets this as the color map for the given workstation.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        procedure gsn_merge_colormaps (
                wks     [1] : graphic,
                color_map1  ,
                color_map2
        )

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   color_map1
   color_map2

   The two color maps to merge. They can be string arrays of named colors, arrays grep of red/blue/green (RGB) triplets,
   and/or predefined color maps.

Description

   This procedure merges two color maps and sets this as the new color map for the given workstation.

   Note: this procedure must be used if you have NCL V6.0.0 or earlier, and want to use more than one color map per page of
   graphics. If you have V6.1.0 or later and are drawing color contours, vectors, or streamlines, then you can associate a
   color map directly with a contour, vector, or streamline plot using these special resources: cnFillPalette,
   vcLevelPalette, and stLevelPalette.

   If the second color map is a list of RGB values or a predefined color map, then the foreground and background colors will
   be dropped from this color map before it is appended to the first color map. If the second color map is a list of named
   colors, then all of the named colors will be appended.

   Since there's a limit of 256 colors in a color map associated with a workstation, the sum total of colors in the two
   color maps must be less than or equal to 256.

   You can use the gsn_draw_colormap procedure to draw the color map (mostly for debugging purposes).

Examples

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
  wks = gsn_open_wks("ncgm","gsn_merge_colormaps")

;---Merge two pre-defined colormaps;
  gsn_merge_colormaps(wks,"rainbow","gsdtol")
  gsn_draw_colormap(wks)

;---Generate grayscale color map.
  gcmap = new((/11,3/),float)
  gcmap(:,0) = ispan(0,10,1)/10.
  gcmap(:,1) = gcmap(:,0)
  gcmap(:,2) = gcmap(:,0)

;---Append grayscale map to the end of a Blue-White-Red color map.
  gsn_merge_colormaps(wks,"BlWhRe",gcmap)
  gsn_draw_colormap(wks)
end
