rgrid2rcm

   Interpolates data on a rectilinear lat/lon grid to a curvilinear grid like those used by the RCM, WRF and NARR
   models/datasets.

Prototype

        function rgrid2rcm (
                lat      [*] : numeric,
                lon      [*] : numeric,
                fi           : numeric,
                lat2d [*][*] : numeric,
                lon2d [*][*] : numeric,
                Option       : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   lat

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the latitude coordinates of the regular grid. Must be monotonically increasing.
   lon

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the longitude coordinates of the regular grid. Must be monotonically increasing.
   fi

   A multi-dimensional array to be interpolated. The rightmost two dimensions (latitude, longitude) are the dimensions to be
   interpolated.
   lat2d

   A two-dimensional array that specifies the latitudes locations of fi. Because this array is two-dimensional it is not an
   associated coordinate variable of fi.
   lon2d

   A two-dimensional array that specifies the longitude locations of fi. Because this array is two-dimensional it is not an
   associated coordinate variable of fi.
   Option

   Reserved for future use. Currently not used. Set to 1.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array of the same size as fi except that the rightmost dimension sizes have been replaced by the
   sizes of lat2d and lon2d respectively. Double if fi is double, otherwise float.

Description

   Interpolates data on a rectilinear lat/lon grid to a curvilinear grid, such as those used by the RCM (Regional Climate
   Model), WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis) models/datasets. No
   extrapolation is performed beyond the range of the input coordinates. The method used is simple inverse distance
   weighting. missing values are allowed but ignored.

   For more robust regridding, see the ESMF regridding examples, which show how to regrid data from and to rectilinear,
   curvilinear, or unstructured grids. Available in version 6.1.0 and later.

Examples

   Example 1

   Interpolate from gaussian T42 (64,128) grid.
   f     = addfile ("some_RCM_file.nc", "r")
   lat2d = f->xlat
   lon2d = f->xlon

   fccm  = addfile ("some_CCM_file.nc", "r")
   x     = fccm->X

   xgrd  = rgrid2rcm (x&lat, x&lon, x, lat2d, lon2d, 0)

   If the output lat2d and lon2d arrays were of size (nlat,nlon), and if the input x was of size:
           x(64,128) ==>  xgrd(nlat,nlon)
      x(ntim,64,128) ==>  xgrd(ntim,nlat,nlon)
 x(ntim,klev,64,128) ==>  xgrd(ntim,klev,nlat,nlon)
