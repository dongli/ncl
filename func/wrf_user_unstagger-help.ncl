wrf_user_unstagger

   Unstaggers an input variable along a specified dimension.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

        function wrf_user_unstagger (
                varin      : numeric,
                unstagDim  : string
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   varin

   Variable that needs to be unstaggered. Must be at least a 2 dimensional variable with the rightmost dimensions ny x nx,
   or a 3 dimensional variable with rightmost dimensions nz x ny x nz to unstagger along the "Z" dimension.
   unstagDim

   Along which dimension must the variable be unstaggered. Options are "X", "Y" or "Z".

Description

   Note: There's a bug in NCL version 5.1.0 of the "WRFUserARW.ncl" file that causes this function to not work with output
   files from metgrid, if you are trying to access the diagnostics "ua" and "va". If you need a fix, the best thing to do is
   download a newer version of NCL, since V5.1.0 is a few years old. Otherwise, you can download a fixed version of
   WRFUserARW.ncl and load this file instead of "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl".

   A variable unstaggered along the unstagDim. The return dimension will be one less in the unstaggered dimension.

   wrf_user_unstagger is part of a library of functions and procedures in WRFUserARW.ncl written to help users plot ARW WRF
   model data.

   Questions on this function should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Example 1

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")


  U = a->U
  ua = wrf_user_unstagger(U,U@stagger)
