uv2vrdvF

   Computes the vorticity and divergence via spherical harmonics, given the u and v wind components on a fixed grid.

Prototype

        function uv2vrdvF (
                u  : numeric,
                v  : numeric
        )

        return_val [2,dimsizes(u)] :  float or double

Arguments

   u
   v

   wind component (input, two or more dimensions, where the rightmost two dimensions must be lat x lon)
     * input values must be in ascending latitude order
     * input array must be on a global grid

Return value

   The returned array will be dimensioned 2 x dimsizes(u), where the leftmost 0-th dimension contains the vorticity and the
   leftmost 1-th dimension contains the divergence (both in ascending latitude order). The returned array will be of type
   double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   uv2vrdvF takes as input u and v and computes the vorticity and divergence. uv2vrdvF operates on a fixed grid.

   This function does not handle missing values (defined by the _FillValue attribute). If any missing values are encountered
   in a particular 2D input grid, then all of the values in the corresponding output grids will be set to the missing value
   defined by the output grids' _FillValue attributes.

   Input arrays should not include the cyclic (wraparound) points when invoking this function, or any procedure or function
   which uses spherical harmonics (Spherepack).

   If the input arrays u and v are on a gaussian grid, uv2vrdvG should be used. Also, note that uv2vrdvF is the function
   version of uv2vrdvf.

   Note, if the input arrays are not global or contain missing data, then it is recommended that uv2vr_cfd be used to
   compute vorticity.

Examples

   Example 1

   Compute the vorticity and divergence given u and v on a fixed grid. Also, compute the rotational wind components and the
   divergent wind components, and finally reconstruct the original wind from the divergence and vorticity fields.

  nrec  = fbinnumrec(fbfile)       ; total number of records in the file

   work = fbinrecread(fbfile,i+1,(/nlat,mlon1/),"float")
   v    = work(:,0:mlon-1)

   vrdvx = uv2vrdvF (u,v)             ; u,v ==> div and vort
   uvd   = dv2uvF (dv)                ; dv  ==> divergent  wind components
   uvr   = vr2uvF (vr)                ; vr  ==> rotational wind components
   uuvv  = vrdv2uvF (vr,dv)           ; vr,dv > reconstruct original wind
  end do
end

Errors

   If jer or ker is equal to:

     1 : error in the specification of nlat
     2 : error in the specification of nlon
     4 : error in the specification of N (jer only)
