v5d_write

   Writes compressed data to a Vis5D+ format file.

Prototype

        procedure v5d_write (
                timestep   [1] : integer,
                varnum     [1] : integer,
                data [*][*][*] : float
        )

Arguments

   timestep

   A scalar timestep number in the range [1...numtimes]

   varnum

   A scalar variable number in the range [1...numvars] indicating which variable you want to write.

   data

   A 3-dimensional float array of gridded data values.

Description

   v5d_write()
   writes data to a file in the Vis5D+ format. The data must be a 3D array of grid values where the number of values to
   write is equal to nr * nc * nl(var), ordered as:
     data[row + nr * (col + nc * lev)]

   where row increases from North to South, col(umn) increases from West to East, and lev(el) increases from bottom to top.

   The data is written in a compressed format. See the documentation for v5d_create for a discussion of how to best utilize
   compression settings for your data.

   For further information on Vis5D+ and file formats, see documentation at the Vis5D website.

  numtimes = 5      ; 5 time steps
  numvars  = 1      ; 1 physical variable
  nr = 30           ; 30 rows in each 3D grid
  nc = 40           ; 40 columns in each 3D grid
  nl = 20           ; 20 levels in each 3D grid

  ...

  v5d_create(..., numvars, nr, nc, nl, (/"myData"/) ...)

;; [fill the 3D grid, from NW bottom corner: grid(0, 0, 0)
;;  to the SE upper corner: grid(nr -1, nc -1, nl - 1)]
