gsn_csm_contour

   Creates and draws a contour plot.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

        function gsn_csm_contour (
                wks [1] : graphic,
                data    : numeric,
                res [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   data

   The data to contour; must be one or two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the contour plot created is returned. The id of the data object is also returned as an attribute called
   data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a contour plot on the given workstation.

   If data is two-dimensional, then a contour plot is generated with the leftmost dimension represented on the Y axis, and
   the rightmost dimension represented on the X axis.

   If data is one-dimensional, then res@sfXArray and res@sfYArray must also be set to one-dimensional arrays of the same
   length, and a triangulation algorithm will be used to generate the contours.

   If data has a _FillValue attribute, this value will be used as a missing value.

   If the resource cnFillOn is set to True, then the following will happen automatically:
     * a labelbar will be automatically added (default horizontal)
     * contour line labels will be turned off
     * the contour information label will be turned off

   If you want to turn the labelbar off, set lbLabelBarOn to False.

   The special resource gsnAddCyclic will be set to False so that no cyclic point will be added to the data.

   If data has an attribute called "long_name", and gsnLeftString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this
   attribute is used for the left string title.

   If data has an attribute called "units", and gsnRightString hasn't explicitly been set, then the value of this attribute
   is used for the right string title.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.
