dtrend_quadratic

   Estimates and removes the least squares quadratic trend of the rightmost dimension from all grid points.

Prototype

        function dtrend_quadratic (
                y       : numeric,
                option  : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(y)] :  numeric

Arguments

   y

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the data to be detrended. The dimension from which the trend is
   calculated needs to be the rightmost dimension. This is usually time. Missing values are not allowed. Use
   dtrend_quadratic_msg_n if missing values are present.
   option

   Currently not used (set to 0).

Return value

   An array of the same size as y. Double if y is double, float otherwise.

Description

   Estimates and removes the least squares quadratic trend of the rightmost dimension from all grid points. Missing values
   are not allowed.

Examples

   Example 1

   y is three-dimensional with dimensions lat, lon, and time. The returned array will have the same size. Remember that the
   mean is also removed.
    yDtrend = dtrend_quadratic(y,0)
