dim_stddev

   Computes the sample standard deviation of a variable's rightmost dimension at all other dimensions.

Prototype

        function dim_stddev (
                x  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality is the same as the first n-2 dimensions of the input variable. That is, the dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   The dim_stddev function computes the sample standard deviation of all elements of the n-1 dimension for each index of the
   dimensions 0...n-2. Missing values are ignored.

   Technically, this function calculates the sample standard deviation. This means that it divides by one less than the
   total number of non-missing values (1/(N-1)).

   Use dim_stddev_n if you want to specify which dimension(s) to calculate the standard deviation on.

   Use dim_stddev_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable q of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the sample standard deviation of the rightmost dimension.
    q   = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qStd= dim_stddev(q)   ;==>  qStd(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let x be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the the standard deviation is:
    xStdLon= dim_stddev( x )    ; ==> xStdLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_stddev_Wrap function
    xStdLon = dim_stddev_Wrap( x )    ; ==> xStdLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let x be defined as in Example 2: x(time,lat,lon). Compute the temporal standard deviation at each latitude/longitude
   grid point. Use NCL's Named Subscripting to reorder the input array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension.

   Note: in V5.1.1, you will be able to use dim_stddev_n to avoid having to reorder your data.

    xStdTime = dim_stddev( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xStdTime(nlat,nlon)
    xStdTime = dim_stddev_n( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed

   If metadata is desired use
    xStdTime = dim_stddev_Wrap( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xStdTime(lat,lon)
    xStdTime = dim_stddev_n_Wrap( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed
