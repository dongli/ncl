gsn_vector_map

   Creates and draws a vector plot over a map.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function gsn_vector_map (
                wks  [1] : graphic,
                u [*][*] : numeric,
                v [*][*] : numeric,
                res  [1] : logical
        )

        return_val [1] :  graphic

Arguments

   wks

   A Workstation identifier. The identifier is one returned either from calling gsn_open_wks or calling create to create a
   Workstation object.
   u
   v

   The u and v data for the vector plot; must be two-dimensional.
   res

   A variable containing an optional list of plot resources, attached as attributes. Set to True if you want the attached
   attributes to be applied, and False if you either don't have any resources to set, or you don't want the resources
   applied.

Return value

   A scalar id of the map created is returned. The id of the vector plot is returned as an attribute called vector, and the
   id of the data is returned as an attribute called data. This is useful if you want to use setvalues to change some data
   or vector options after this function has been called.

Description

   This function creates and draws a vector plot over a map on the given workstation.

   If either u or v have a _FillValue attribute, these values will be used as missing values.

   You should use gsn_csm_vector_map if you want a more customized vector plot and/or if your data has coordinate arrays.

   To maximize the area that the plot is drawn in, set the special resource gsnMaximize to True.

Examples

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

begin
  dir = ncargpath("data")
  uf = addfile(dir+"/cdf/Ustorm.cdf","r")  ; Open two netCDF files.
  vf = addfile(dir+"/cdf/Vstorm.cdf","r")

  u   = uf->u(0,:,:)   ; Get u, v, lat, lon data.
  v   = vf->v(0,:,:)
  lat = uf->u&lat
  lon = uf->u&lon

  wks = gsn_open_wks("x11","gsn_vector_map") ; Open a workstation.

  resources = True

  nlon = dimsizes(lon)
  nlat = dimsizes(lat)
  resources@vfXCStartV  = lon(0)      ; Define lat/lon corners
  resources@vfXCEndV    = lon(nlon-1) ; for vector plot.
  resources@vfYCStartV  = lat(0)
  resources@vfYCEndV    = lat(nlat-1)

  map = gsn_vector_map(wks,u,v,resources)  ; Draw a vector plot of
                                           ; u and v over a map.
