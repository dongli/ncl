variance

   Computes an unbiased estimate the variance of all input points.

Prototype

        function variance (
                value  : numeric
        )

        return_val [1] :  float or double

Arguments

   value

   An array of any dimensionality.

Return value

   Returns a floating point value, or type double if value is of type double.

Description

   This function computes the unbiased estimate of the variance for all input points, regardless of the dimensionality of
   the input. Technically, this function calculates an estimate of the sample variance. This means that it divides by
   [1/(N-1)] where N is the total number of non-missing values.

Examples

   Example 1

   The following calculates the population and sample variance of 5 values. For illustration, a step-by-step calculation of
   the variance is done. The variances returned by NCL's three built-in variance funtions are included.

  f      = (/ 7, 9, -2, -8, 2/)

  favg   = avg(f)             ; average
  fdev   = f-favg             ; deviations
  fdev2  = fdev^2             ; deviations squared
  nf     = dimsizes(f)        ; N

  pvar   = sum(fdev2)/nf      ; population variance

  svar   = sum(fdev2)/(nf-1)  ; sample variance
  var1   = variance(f)
  var2   = dim_variance(f)
  var3   = dim_variance_n(f,0)

  print("pvar="+pvar+"  svar="+svar+"  var1="+var1+"  var2="+var2+"  var3="+var3)

===
output:   pvar=37.84  svar=47.3  var1=47.3  var2=47.3  var3=47.3


   Example 2

   The following calculates the overall variance of a (3,5,10) array, f.
  f = onedtond(ispan(1, 150, 1), (/3, 5, 10/))
  variance_f = variance(f)
  print(variance_f)
