hsv2rgb

   Maps values from the HSV color model to the RGB color model (deprecated).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"

        function hsv2rgb (
                h [*] : float,
                s [*] : float,
                v [*] : float
        )

        return_val [*][3] :  float

Arguments

   h

   A one-dimensional array of hue values. The values must range from 0 to 360 inclusive.
   s

   A one-dimensional array of saturation values (same length as h). The values must range from 0 to 1 inclusive.
   v

   A one-dimensional array of brightness (or intensity) values (same length as h). The values must range from 0 to 1
   inclusive.

Return value

   The return value will be an n x 3 float array, where n is the length of h.

Description

   Note: this function will be deprecated after version 4.3.1. Use hsvrgb instead.

   This function maps values from the HSV color model to the RGB color model. HSV is a good model for generating smooth
   color maps. See "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice by Foley".

   The return value from this function can be directly assigned to the wkColorMap resource of a workstation object or to the
   second argument of gsn_define_colormap.
