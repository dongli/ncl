tdsort

   Sorts an array (for use with selected TDPACK routines).

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function tdsort (
                rwrk      [*] : float,
                sort_flag [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(rwrk)] :  float

Arguments

   rwrk

   A float array of length nwrk you want to sort.
   sort_flag

   An integer scalar, that if set to zero, will cause the sort to go from the smallest to the greatest value. If set to
   non-zero, it will sort from largest to smallest value.

Description

   This routine is part of the low-level TDPACK package, which is a group of Fortran and C callable routines for projecting
   objects from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having X and Y
   axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects. This can be referred to somewhat loosely as "drawing objects in
   three dimensions".

   Given an array of nrwk reals in an array rwrk and a "sorting flag" sort_flag, tdsort returns a permutation vector iwrk of
   length nwrk such that, for every i and j such that 1 <= i <= j <= nwrk, if sort_flag is zero, then rwrk(iwrk(i)) <=
   rwrk(iwrk(j)), else rwrk(iwrk(i)) >= rwrk(iwrk(j)).

   Please see the documentation on TDSORT for a full description of this function.
