doubletoshort

   Coerces values of type double to values of type short (deprecated; use toshort).

Prototype

        function doubletoshort (
                double_val  : double
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(double_val)] :  short

Arguments

   double_val

   A double variable of any dimension.

Return value

   The return variable is of the same dimensionality as the input variable.

   Any fractional part of an input value is truncated and the result is then returned as a short. Any result that is out of
   range for a short is set to a missing value.

Description

   This function converts double values to short values.

   Note: this function and other xxxtoshort functions have been superceded by toshort.

   Any fractional part of an input value is truncated and the result returned as a short. Any result that is out of range
   for a short is set to the missing value for a short (default = -99).

   This function performs coercion that is not automatically available through the NCL grammar. See the section on coercion
   of types for details on NCL's automatic type conversions.

   Attributes, with the exception of _FillValue, are not propagated by the conversion functions. See Example 2 below.

   Special considerations apply to how missing values and out-of-range values are handled in the conversion functions. For
   this function an out-of-range value is a valid double precision number that is not in the valid range of a short, or a
   numeric value that is outside the range of a valid double. An out-of-range value is converted to a missing value, but
   what that missing value is depends on the circumstances of the particular conversion being performed. For example,
   determination has to be made whether a missing value for a variable to be converted is in the range of the type of the
   target variable. Example 2 below illustrates most of the many possibilities; its output should provide convincing
   evidence that care must be taken when making assumptions about the results returned from a conversion function when the
   original variable has missing or out-of-range values.

Examples

   Example 1

   Converts an array of doubles to shorts.

begin
  a = (/ 0.d, 1.d, 10.d, 300.d, -1.d, 1.8d, 300.88d, 32800.d, 68000.d/)
  print (doubletoshort(a))
end


   Example 2

   Shows how missing values and out-of-range values are handled.

begin
;
;  Conversion does not preserve attributes, except missing value.
;
  a = (/ -1.1d, 2.5d, 3.9d/)
  a@T = "string"
  a@_FillValue = -444.d
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  The missing value of the target variable is retained if
;  the missing value of the original variable is out of
;  the range of the target variable.  Note that this can
;  turn a value that is not a missing value in the original
;  variable into a missing value in the target variable if
;  a value in the original variable equals the missing value
;  in the target variable.  For example, if -444.d were a
;  value in "a" below, it would become a missing value in "b".
;
  a = (/ -1.d, -2.d, 3.d/)
  a@_FillValue = 1.d40
  b = new(3,short,integertoshort(-444))
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  Values to be converted that are out of the range
;  of the target variable are converted to the default missing value
;  of the target variable if neither the original variable nor
;  the target variable has a missing value specified.
;
  a = (/ -1.d, 2.d, 3.d20/)
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  Values to be converted that are out of the range
;  of the target variable are converted to the missing value
;  of the original variable, if that missing value is in
;  the range of the target variable and the target variable
;  has no missing value specified.
;
  a = (/ -1.d, 2.d, 3.d20/)
  a@_FillValue = -444.d
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  Values to be converted that are out of the range
;  of the target variable are converted to the default missing value
;  of the target variable if the missing value of the
;  original variable is out of the range of the target variable
;  and the target variable has no missing value specified.
;
  a = (/ -1.d, 2.d, 3.d20/)
  a@_FillValue = 1.d50
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has no missing value
;  specified and the original variable does, the missing
;  value of the target variable inherits the missing value of the
;  original variable and the missing values
;  of the original variable are retained in
;  the target variable.
;
  a = (/ -1.d, 2.d, -444.d/)
  a@_FillValue = -444.d
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has a missing
;  value specified and the original variable
;  has a missing value specified, the missing
;  value of the target variable is retained
;  even when the missing value of the original
;  variable is in the range of the type of the
;  target variable.  Missing values in the
;  original variable are converted to the
;  missing value of the target variable.
;
  a = (/ -1.d, 2.d, -444.d/)
  a@_FillValue = -444.d
  b = new(3,short,integertoshort(-666))
  b = doubletoshort(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
end
