vr2uvG

   Computes the rotational wind components via spherical harmonics, given an array containing relative vorticity on a
   gaussian grid.

Prototype

        function vr2uvG (
                vr  : numeric
        )

        return_val [2,dimsizes(vr)] :  float or double

Arguments

   vr

   vorticity array (input, array with two or more dimensions, last two dimensions must be nlat x nlon)
     * input values must be in ascending latitude order
     * array must be on a global grid

Return value

   The returned array will be dimensioned 2 x dimsizes(vr), where the leftmost 0-th dimension contains the u component and
   the leftmost 1-th dimension contains the v component (both in ascending latitude order). The returned array will be of
   type double if the input is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   vr2uvG computes the rotational wind components given an array, vr, containing relative vorticity. vr2uvG operates on a
   gaussian grid.

   This function does not handle missing values (defined by the _FillValue attribute). If any missing values are encountered
   in a particular 2D input grid, then all of the values in the corresponding output grids will be set to the missing value
   defined by the output grids' _FillValue attributes.

   Input arrays should not include the cyclic (wraparound) points when invoking this function, or any procedure or function
   which uses spherical harmonics (Spherepack).

   If the input array vr is on a fixed grid, vr2uvF should be used. Also, note that vr2uvG is the function version of
   vr2uvg.

   Use vr2uvG_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Let vrt(nlat,mlon) be on a gaussian grid, and contain the relative vorticity. Then:
uvr = vr2uvG (vrt)

   will return the rotational zonal and meridional wind components.

     uvr(0,nlat,mlon) <== ROTATIONAL zonal wind components
     uvr(1,nlat,mlon) <== ROTATIONAL meridional wind components

   These values are the same as those returned by the procedural version of this routine but the user does not have to
   explicitly allocate memory. For example:

  ur = new (dimsizes(vrt), typeof(vrt))
  vr = new (dimsizes(vrt), typeof(vrt))
  vr2uvg (vrt, ur, vr)

   Example 2

   Let vrt(ntim,klev,nlat,mlon) be on a gaussian grid, and contain the relative vorticity. Then:
  uvr = vr2uvG (vrt)

   will return the rotational zonal and meridional wind components.

     uvr(0,ntim,klev,nlat,mlon) <== ROTATIONAL zonal wind components
     uvr(1,ntim,klev,nlat,mlon) <== ROTATIONAL meridional wind components

   Example 3

   Read u/v (on a gaussian grid) from a netCDF file, compute relative vorticity, and then compute the rotational wind
   components.
  f = addfile ("UV.nc", "r")
  u = f->U
  v = f->V

  vrt = uv2vrG (u, v)   ; compute vorticity
  uvr = vr2uvG (vrt)    ; compute rotational wind components

Errors

   If jer or ker is equal to:

     1 : error in the specification of nlat
     2 : error in the specification of nlon
     4 : error in the specification of N (jer only)
