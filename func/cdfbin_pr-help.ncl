cdfbin_pr

   Calculates the probability of success of each trial of a cumulative distribution function.

Prototype

        function cdfbin_pr (
                p   : numeric,
                s   : numeric,
                xn  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   p

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the binomial density. The binomial density is the probability of s or
   fewer successes in xn trials each with probability of success pr (input/output range: [0,1]).
   s

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the number of observed successes (Must be > 0)
   xn

   A multi-dimensional array or scalar value equal to the number of binomial trials (Must be > 0). Must be the same size as
   s.

Return value

   A array of the same size as s. Double if any of the input arguments are double, float otherwise.

Description

   Calculates the probability of success of each trial of a cumulative distribution function.

   The source code is from source routine "CDFBIN" from DCDFLIB (Double precision Cumulative Distribution Function LIBrary)

Examples

   Example 1

     p     = 0.95
     xn    = 30.0
     s     = 25.7267

     PR= cdfbin_pr(p,s,xn)
     print("PR="+PR)             ; PR= 0.75
