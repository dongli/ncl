f2gshv_Wrap

   Interpolates a vector quantity on a fixed grid to a Gaussian grid (optional truncation) (retains metadata).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        procedure f2gshv_Wrap (
                ua        : numeric,
                va        : numeric,
                ub        : float,    ; or double
                vb        : float,    ; or double
                twave [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   ua
   va

   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. The values must be in
   ascending latitude order.
   ub
   vb

   (output)
   Vector arrays of 2 or more dimensions whose rightmost two dimensions must be latitude x longitude. Values will be in
   ascending latitude order. All but the two rightmost dimensions must be the same as all but the two rightmost dimensions
   of ua and va.

   Since f2gshv_Wrap is a procedure, the user must explicitly preallocate memory for these return arrays.
   twave

   Scalar integer indicating the optional wave truncation:
   twave = 0 => exact interpolation
       twave > 0 => exact interpolation and triangular truncation at twave
       twave < 0 => exact interpolation, triangular truncation at twave and spectral coefficient tapering (the effect is to
       smooth the data)

Description

   f2gshv_Wrap interpolates a vector pair on a fixed grid (ua,va) to a Gaussian grid (ub,vb) (optional truncation) using
   spherical harmonics (via the Spherepack code).

   Arrays which have dimensions [...] x nlata x nlona should not include the cyclic (wrap-around) points when invoking this
   procedure. For example, if arrays u and v have dimensions nlata = 64 and nlona = 129, where the "129" represents the
   cyclic point, then the user should pass the data to f2gshv_Wrap via:
  z = f2gshv_Wrap(u(...,0:nlona-2), v(...,0:nlona-2),...)  ; does not include cyclic points

   This procedure can only be used on grids that span the globe. It cannot be used for limited area grids.

   Please read the caveats that you should be aware of when using spherical harmonic regridding.

   This function is identical to the built-in function f2gshv except it retains metadata.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume u and v are dimensioned nt x nlat x nlon, and that they are of type float or double.

   The code below interpolates from a fixed 2.5 degree grid (nlat=73, nlon=144) to a Gaussian "t42" grid (jlat=64,ilon=128)
   with triangular truncation at wave 42:
  uNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(u) )
  vNew = new ( (/nt,jlat,ilon/), typeof(v) )

  f2gshv_Wrap (u,v, uNew,vNew, 42)

Errors

   ier is equal to:

     4 or 10 if nlona (ilon) is less than 4
     5 or 10 if nlata (jlat) is less than 3
     8 if nlonb is less than 4
     9 if nlatb is less than 3
