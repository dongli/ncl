list_files

   Lists all of the variables that reference files.

Prototype

        procedure list_files (
        )

Description

   Lists all of the current variables containing references to files. These variables were created by the addfile function.
   If run at the command line, this procedure invokes a pager for scrolling through the list. The pager is either "more" or
   whatever the user's PAGER environment variable is set to.

Examples

   Example 1
     f = addfile("hgt.mon.mean.nc","r")
     g = addfile("slp.mon.mean.nc" ,"r")
     h = addfile("soi.nc" ,"r")

     list_files()

   outputs to standard out:
