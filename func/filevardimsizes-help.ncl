filevardimsizes

   Returns the dimension sizes of variable on a supported file.

Prototype

        function filevardimsizes (
                thefile [1] : file,
                varname [1] : string
        )

        return_val [*] :  integer or long

Arguments

   thefile

   reference to a file. It is created using addfile or addfiles. Thus, it must be a supported file format.
   varname

   string name of variable whose dimension sizes are desired

Return value

   Returns a one dimensional array of dimension sizes for a file variable. In versions 5.x or earlier, this function always
   returns an integer array. In versions 6.0.0 or later, this function may return a long array. See below.

Description

   This function works just like dimsizes, but for file variables. This function should be used rather than dimsizes when
   the variable is in a file. The dimsizes function is very inefficient to use on file variables because it reads in the
   entire variable. The filevardimsizes function should be used exclusively when querying the dimensionality of variables in
   files.

   As of version 6.0.0, this function will return type "long" if the product of the dimension sizes is greater than or equal
   to 2 GB.

   Note: This function is exactly the same as getfilevardimsizes. It is kept under this name for historical purposes.

Examples

   Example 1 Consider a netCDF file where "ncdump -h Tstorm.nc" yields:
netcdf Tstorm {
dimensions:
        timestep = 64 ;
        lat = 33 ;
        lon = 36 ;
        timelen = 20 ;
variables:
        float t(timestep, lat, lon) ;
                t:_FillValue = -9999.f ;
        int timestep(timestep) ;
        float lat(lat) ;
        float lon(lon) ;
        char reftime(timelen) ;
                reftime:units = "text_time" ;
                reftime:long_name = "reference time" ;
}

  a    = addfile("$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/data/cdf/Tstorm.cdf","r")

  dimt = filevardimsizes(a,"t")
  print(dimt)

   This produces the following output:
Variable: dimt
Type: integer
Total Size: 12 bytes
            3 values
Number of Dimensions: 1
Dimensions and sizes:   [3]
Coordinates:

(0)     64
(1)     33
(2)     36
