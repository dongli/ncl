array_append_record

   Attaches [appends] additional records [leftmost dimension] to a previously existing array.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.2.0.a034 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function array_append_record (
                x1      ,
                x2      ,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   x1

   An array of any shape and type.
   x2

   An array of the same rank as x1. All dimensions to the right of the record (leftmost) dimension must be identical.
   opt

   An integer. Set to 0. Currently, not used.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array. The rightmost dimensions will be the same as on input. The left dimension will have additional
   records appended to the x1 array.

Examples

   Example 1

   Consider the two multi-dimensional arrays x1 and x2. It is desired to append x2 to the x1 array and return a new array.

   Let x1(ntim1, nlat,mlon) and x2(ntim2, nlat,mlon). Note that x1 and x2 right dimensions are the same size.

   Then
   a = array_append_record (x1, x2, 0)

  ;delete(x1)
  ;delete(x2)


   will yield a(ntim, nlat, mlon) where ntim=ntim1+ntim2
