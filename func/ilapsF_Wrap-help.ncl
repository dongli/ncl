ilapsF_Wrap

   Inverts the Laplacian (on a fixed grid) using spherical harmonics and retains metadata.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function ilapsF_Wrap (
                zlap    : numeric,
                zlmbda  : numeric
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(zlap)] :  float or double

Arguments

   zlap

   An array of two or more dimensions containing the Laplacian values to invert. Last two dimensions must be lat and lon.
   Values must be in ascending latitudinal order. Grid must be global.
   zlmbda

   A constant if zlap is a two-dimensional. If zlap has three or more dimensions then must be the same size as zlap minus
   the rightmost two dimensions.

Return value

   An array of the same size as zlap. Double if zlap or zlmbda is double, float otherwise.

Description

   Inverts the Laplacian (on a fixed grid) using spherical harmonics and retains metadata. Missing values are not allowed.

   If zlmbda is identically zero, the poisson equation is solved. Otherwise, the Helmholtz equation is solved.

   Should not include the cyclic (wraparound) points. This is a restriction of the spherical harmonic (Spherepack) routines.
   Here is an example of passing in a two-dimensional array in which the last longitude point is left out.
    z = sample ( x(:,0:nlon-2) )            ; does not include cyclic points

   If zlap is on a gaussian grid, ilapsG_Wrap should be used.

   This function is identical to the built-in function ilapsF except it retains metadata.

Examples

   Example 1

   Read Z (on a fixed grid) from a netCDF file and compute the inverse laplacian, solving the Poisson equation (k=0):
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"
begin
   a = addfile("/cgd/cas/shea/MURPHYS/ATMOS/80.fixed.nc","r")
   z200 = a->Z(0,{189.},:,:)                    ; z200 is dimensioned nlat x nlon
   printVarSummary(z200)
   ilapl = ilapsF_Wrap(z200,0)
end

Errors

   If jer or ker is equal to:

     1 : error in the specification of nlat
     2 : error in the specification of nlon
     4 : error in the specification of N (jer only)
