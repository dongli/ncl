fbinnumrec

   Returns the number of unformatted sequential Fortran records in a binary file.

Prototype

        function fbinnumrec (
                path [1] : string
        )

        return_val [1] :  integer

Arguments

   path

   Pathname of file

Description

   This function returns the number of records in a Fortran unformatted sequential binary file.

   It was updated in version 4.3.0 in order to allow reads into files bigger than 2 GB. This change allows you to access
   records that occur past the 2 GB point in the file, but not to read into variables that would be larger than 2 GB.

     Caveat: we've run across binary files that were written with 8-byte record markers. This function may expect them to
     be 4-bytes; it just depends on what system NCL was compiled on.

     This happens if the Fortran program that created the binary file was compiled with a version of "g77" or "gfortran"
     that sets the marker size to whatever "off_t" is on that system.

     In V6.1.1 and later, you can change this to 8 bytes using the "RecordMarkerSize" option in the setfileoption
     procedure.

     As a work-around for older versions of NCL, you can recompile the code that created the binary file with the option
     "-frecord-marker=4" to force a 4-byte record, and run the code again to regenerate the file.

Examples

   Example 1

   Determine the number of records on a file created opening the file via the fortran statement: open(10, "foo.binary",
   form="unformatted")

   nrec = fbinnumrec("foo.binary")   ; nrec is scalar integer
