stringtolong

   Coerces values of type string to values of type long.

Prototype

        function stringtolong (
                string_val  : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(string_val)] :  long

Arguments

   string_val

   A string variable of any dimensionality. The strings in this variable must be ASCII representations of numeric values,
   such as "123", "44" and so forth. If a conversion from a string to a long value is not possible, an error is issued. NCL
   tries hard to make sense out of some strings that may not really represent a long - in a given string it looks for the
   maximum number of initial characters that make sense as a long value and ignores the rest. For example it would interpret
   the string "3.4etotthefifth" as the value 3 and "2.9" as the long 2 . Note that "1 23" would be converted to 1, since
   spaces signal the end of what is considered the meaningful numeric part of a string. Also, "1.23E+5" would be interpreted
   as 1, since the period would signal the end of the meaningful part of the string as a long.

   Hexadecimal numbers are represented in string input using a special syntax. If the first two characters in an input
   string are "0x" or "0X", then the string is assumed to represent a hexadecimal number and the conversion to an integer
   will result in a decimal integer. For strings representing hexadecimal numbers, all digits must be in the set of sixteen
   characters {0-9,A-D} - the conversion terminates with any character not in this set. See Example 3 for examples of
   hexadecimal conversions.

Return value

   Returns an array of longs. The return variable is of the same dimensionality as the input variable.

Description

   This function takes strings that are ASCII representations of numeric values and converts them to longs.

   This function performs coercion that is not automatically available through the NCL grammar. See the section on coercion
   of types for details on NCL's automatic type conversions.

   Attributes, with the exception of _FillValue, are not propagated by the conversion functions. See Example 2 below.

   Special considerations apply to how missing values are handled in the conversion functions. See Example 2 below for
   illustrations.

Examples

   Example 1

   Convert various strings to long values.

begin
  a = (/ "1", "23", "2.71828E+2", "3junk", 1.23E+4 /)
  b = stringtolong(a)
  print(b)
end


   Example 2

   Shows how some missing values are handled.

begin
;
;  Conversion does not preserve attributes, except missing value.
;  A string missing value is converted to a long,
;  if that is possible, and used as the missing value
;  for the target variable.
;
  a = "1.23"
  a@T = "string"
  a@_FillValue = "4.56"
  b = stringtolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has no missing value
;  specified and the original variable does, the missing
;  value of the target string is the missing value
;  of the original string.
;
  a = (/"1.23","4.56","7.89"/)
  a@_FillValue = "4"
  b = stringtolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has a missing
;  value specified and the original variable
;  has a missing value specified, the missing
;  value of the target variable is retained
;  even when the missing value of the original
;  variable is convertible to a long.
;  Missing values in the original variable are
;  converted to the missing value of the target variable.
;
  a = (/"1","4","8"/)
  a@_FillValue = "4"
  b = new(3,long,7)
  b = stringtolong(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If missing value of the original variable
;  ("missing" in most circumstances) is not
;  convirtable to a long, then the missing
;  value for the target variable will obtain.
;  Missing values in the original variable are
;  converted to the missing value of the target
;  variable.
;
  a = (/"1","4","XXX"/)
  a@_FillValue = "XXX"
  b = stringtolong(a)
  print (b)
end


   Example 3

   Shows how hexadecimal string representations are handled.
begin
;
;  Specify an array of strings representing hexadecimal numbers
;
  c = (/"0x5", "0X10", "0x9A"/)
;
;  Convert to hexadecimal integers, getting (/5, 16, 154/).
;
  d = stringtolong(c)
  print(d)
end

Errors

   If NCL cannot make sense of an input string as an integer value, an error is issued.
