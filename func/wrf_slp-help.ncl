wrf_slp

   Calculates sea level pressure from ARW WRF model output.

Prototype

        function wrf_slp (
                Z  : numeric,
                T  : numeric,
                P  : numeric,
                Q  : numeric
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(Z)] :  float or double

Arguments

   Z

   Geopotential height in [m] with at least 3 dimensions. It must be on the ARW WRF unstaggered grid. The rightmost three
   dimensions must be level bottom_top x lat (south_north) x lon (west_east).
   T

   Temperature in [K]. An array with the same dimensionality as Z. This variable can be calculated by wrf_tk.
   P

   Full pressure (perturbation + base state pressure) in [Pa]. An array of the same dimensionality as Z.
   Q

   Water vapor mixing ratio in [kg/kg]. An array of the same dimensionality as Z.

Return value

   This function returns an array whose rightmost two dimensions are the same as the rightmost two dimensions of the input
   variables (lat x lon). The type will be double if any of the input is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   This function calculates sea level pressure from ARW WRF model output. It also makes sure there are no negative values in
   Q by setting them all to 0.

   The return variable will contain two attributes:

     return_val@description = "Sea Level Pressure"
     return_val@units = "hPa"

   As of version 5.1.0, the return variable will contain all but the rightmost third named dimensions (if any) of T.
   Otherwise, the rightmost two dimensions will be named "south_north" and "west_east".

   Questions on this function should be sent to wrfhelp@ucar.edu.

Examples

   Note: for WRF variable names and their definitions, you can easily check them by using "ncl_filedump":
  ncl_filedump wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc

   Example 1

       T  = nc_file->T(time,:,:,:)
       th = T + 300.

       P  = nc_file->P(time,:,:,:)
       PB = nc_file->PB(time,:,:,:)
       p  = ( P + PB )

       tk = wrf_tk( p , th )

       QVAPOR = nc_file->QVAPOR(time,:,:,:)
       PH     = nc_file->PH(time,:,:,:)
       PHB    = nc_file->PHB(time,:,:,:)
       var    = ( PH + PHB ) / 9.81
       dim    = dimsizes(var)
       z      = 0.5 * ( var(0:dim(0)-2,:,:) + var(1:dim(0)-1,:,:) )

       slp   = wrf_slp( z, tk, p, QVAPOR )

   Example 2

   The function wrf_user_getvar, (available in the $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl script) can also be
   used to calculate many diagnostics in one step.

  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
  load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/wrf/WRFUserARW.ncl"

  a = addfile("wrfout_d01_2000-01-24_12:00:00.nc","r")

  time = 1
  slp = wrf_user_getvar(a,"slp",time)  ; calculate SLP
