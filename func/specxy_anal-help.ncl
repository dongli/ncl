specxy_anal

   Calculates cross spectra quantities of a series.

Prototype

        function specxy_anal (
                x    [*] : numeric,
                y    [*] : numeric,
                iopt [1] : integer,
                jave [1] : integer,
                pct  [1] : numeric
        )

        return_val [1] :  float or double

Arguments

   x
   y

   One-dimensional arrays containing the data. x and y must be the same length, and missing values are not allowed.
   iopt

   A scalar representing the detrending option:

   iopt = 0
          Remove series mean.

   iopt = 1
          Remove the series mean and least squares linear trend.

   jave

   A scalar representing the smoothing to be performed on the periodogram estimates. This should be an odd number (>= 3). If
   not, the routine will force it to the next largest odd number.

   jave < 3
          Do no smoothing. spcx contains raw spectra estimates (periodogram).

   jave >= 3
          Average jave periodogram estimates together utilizing modified daniell smoothing (good stability but may lead to
          large bias). All weights are 1/jave except weight(1) and weight(jave) which are 1/(2*jave). This is the
          recommended option. It is this number which has the most impact on the degrees of freedom.

   pct

   A scalar representing the percent of the series to be tapered (0.0 <= pct <= 1.0). If pct =0.0, no tapering will be done.
   If pct = 1.0, the whole series is effected. A value of 0.10 is common (tapering should always be done).

Return value

   The return value is a scalar representing the degrees of freedom. The scalar will be double if x, y, or pct are double,
   and float otherwise. See the description below for a list of attributes that are also returned.

Description

   specxy_anal returns the degrees of freedom as a scalar. It also returns the following attributes:

   spcx,spcy
          One-dimensional arrays of length N/2.

          spcx(0) - spectral estimate at frequency = (1/N)
          [N=dimsizes(x)]

          spcx(N/2-1)- spectral estimate at frequency = 0.5

          These spectra have been normalized so that the area under the curve:

     (spcx(0)+spcx(N/2-1))*(df/2) + SUM{spcx(n)*df}

          equals the variance of the detrended series, where df=(1/N)=frequency spacing and n=1 to N/2-2.

          The units are variance/(unit frequency interval).

   frq
          A one-dimensional array of length N/2 representing frequency (cycles/time).

   cospc
          A one-dimensional array of length N/2 representing the cospectrum. This is the real part of the cross spectrum. It
          measures the extent to which there are oscillations with the same phase in the two series (or with opposite sign,
          i.e. with a phase shift of half a cycle). In other words, it measures the contribution of different frequencies to
          the total cross-covariance at zero lag.

   quspc
          A one-dimensional array of length N/2 representing the quadrature spectrum. This is the imaginary part of the
          cross spectrum. it measures the extent to which there are oscillations with a phase difference of a quarter cycle
          in either direction. i.e., It measures the contribution of different frequencies to the total cross-covariance of
          the series when all harmonics of one series are delayed a quarter cycle relative to the other relative to the
          other series.

   coher
          A one-dimensional array of length N/2 representing coherence squared. This is analogous to the square of the
          correlation coef except that the coherence squared is a function of frequency.

   phase
          A one-dimensional array of length N/2 representing the phase in degrees. A positive phase indicates that x leads
          y.

   bw
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the spectral band width.

   coher_probability
          An array of length 4 containing the coherence corresponding to the 90, 95, 99, and 99.9% levels.

   xavei
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the average of the x series on input.

   xvari
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the variance of the x series on input.

   xvaro
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the variance of the x series after detrending.

   xlag1
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the lag one auto correlation of the x series after detrending.

   xslope
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the least squares slope per time interval of linear trend (if iopt =
          1) of the x series.

   yavei
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the average of the y series on input.

   yvari
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the variance of the y series on input.

   yvaro
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the variance of the y series after detrending.

   ylag1
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the lag one auto correlation of the y series after detrending.

   yslope
          A scalar (same type as output) representing the least squares slope per time interval of linear trend (if iopt =
          1) of the y series.

   Some NCL users have asked about testing for significance. The following may help:

Coherence Significance Levels

Comments on the Determination of Significance Levels of the Coherence Statistic

(i)  B = 1-p**(1/(df/2-1))  where B=coherence-squared

(ii) Solving for p

      p = (1-B)^(df/2-1)

Looking at Table 1 of the article

      n  = 4
      df = 8.0     ; degrees of freedom

(i) What coherence-squared (coherence)
     is needed for a significance level of p=0.05

      B = 1.0-p^(1.0/(df/2.0 -1.0))   ;   ===> 0.6315969

      b = sqrt(B)                     ; coherence==>0.7947307

===

(ii) At what probability level does a calculated coherence-squared
    (coherence^2) fall ... given an estimated 'df'

     B = 0.63

     p = (1-B)^(df/2-1)   ; ==> 0.05

Sometimes statistics are returned via

     P = 1-p    ; P=0.95

Examples

   Example 1

   Perform cross-spectral analysis on series x and y:

   iopt = 1    ; remove least squares linear trends from each
               ; series prior to tapering and computing spectra.
   jave = 7    ; Average 7 periodogram estimates using modified Daniel
   pct  = 0.1  ; taper 10% of the data
   dof = specxy_anal (x,y,iopt,jave,pct)
