read_colormap_file

   Reads an NCL system colormap file or a user-defined colormap.

   [new.gif] Available in version 6.1.0 and later.

Prototype

        function read_colormap_file (
                filename  : string
        )

Arguments

   filename

   The name of a colormap from NCL's system colormaps, or the name of a file containing a user-defined color map.

Return value

   A float array of size n x 4 is returned, where n is the number of colors in the colormap. Colors are 4-tuples of red,
   green, blue, opacity values, in the range [0., 1.].

Description

   [Note: in NCL versions 6.1.2 or earlier, you must load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl" to use this
   function. In later versions, you don't need to load anything.]

   This is a convenience function for loading NCL's system colormaps or user-specified colormaps. While general-purpose in
   nature, its primary use-case is loading colormaps that are then assigned to resources such as cnFillPalette,
   cnFillColors, vcLevelPalette, vcLevelColors, stLevelColors, stLevelPalette, or mpFillColors.

   Note that the function always returns 4-component colors, consisting of red/green/blue/opacity values. If the source
   color tables do not contain opacity values, a default of 1.0 (opaque) is returned.

   The function follows all the naming and searching conventions for locating files as described here.

Examples

   For several examples of manipulating color using the new color display introduced in NCL V6.1.0, see the "New color
   capabilities" examples page.

   Example 1

   This example shows how to read an existing color map, and then subscript part of it for a filled contour plot:
  cmap = read_colormap_file("BlAqGrYeOrReVi200")
...
  res@cnFillColors = cmap(3:,:)    ; Skips the first two colors

   Example 2

   This example shows how to read an existing color map, and make part of it transparent for a filled contour plot:
  cmap       = read_colormap_file("OceanLakeLandSnow")
...
  cmap(0:1,) = 0.0    ; Make first two blue colors fully transparent
  res@cnFillColors = cmap
