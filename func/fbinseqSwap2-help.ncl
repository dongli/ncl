fbinseqSwap2

   Byte swaps Fortran sequential files (more memory friendly) (deprecated).

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        procedure fbinseqSwap2 (
                in_file  [1] : string,
                out_file [1] : string,
                type     [1] : string,
                dims     [*] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  file

Arguments

   in_file

   Name of input file.
   out_file

   Name of output file.
   type

   The type of the data on in_file (e.g. "float")
   dims

   A one-dimensional array or equal to the dimensionality of the input data.

Description

   Note: this function is deprecated. You can now use the "ReadByteOrder" and "WriteByteOrder" options in setfileoption to
   indicate how the various NCL binary read/write functions should read and write files.

   Byte swaps Fortran sequential files. A more memory friendly version than fbinseqSwap1. It requires that all records in
   the file be the same type and dimension. The user must provide the dimensionality of each record, but not necessarily the
   number of records. If the wrong dimensions are input, the data will be distorted.

Examples

   Example 1

   In the following, N is record length [eg N=1000 , (/nlat,mlon/) ]
   load $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl

   fbinseqSwap2("foo.input", "foo.output", "float",  N)
