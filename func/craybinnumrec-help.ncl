craybinnumrec

   Returns the number of unformatted sequential access Fortran records in a Cray COS blocked binary file.

Prototype

        function craybinnumrec (
                path [1] : string
        )

        return_val [1] :  integer

Arguments

   path

   pathname of file

Description

   This function returns the number of records in a COS blocked Fortran unformatted sequential access binary file. The COS
   blocked file must have been created via the Fortran open statement, e.g.:
      open (...,form="unformatted",...).

Examples

   Example 1

   Determine the number of records on a file created on a Cray when opening the file via the Fortran statement: open(10,
   "foo.COS", form="unformatted")

   nrec = craybinnumrec("foo.COS")   ; nrec is scalar integer
