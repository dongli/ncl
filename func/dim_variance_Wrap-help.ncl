dim_variance_Wrap

   Computes unbiased estimates of the variance of a variable's rightmost dimension at all other dimensions and retains
   metadata.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function dim_variance_Wrap (
                x  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality is the same as the first n-2 dimensions of the input variable. That is, the dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by one.

Description

   The dim_variance_Wrap function computes the population variance of all elements of the n-1 dimension for each index of
   the dimensions 0...n-2 and retains metadata. A wrapper function. Missing values are ignored.

   Technically, this function calculates an estimate of the population variance. This means that it divides by [1/(N-1)]
   where N is the total number of non-missing values.

   Use dim_variance_n_Wrap if you want to specify which dimensions to do the calculation across.

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable q of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the population variance of the rightmost dimension.
    q   = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qVar= dim_variance(q)   ;==>  qVar(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let x be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the the variance is:
    xVarLon= dim_variance( x )    ; ==> xVarLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_variance_Wrap function
    xVarLon = dim_variance_Wrap( x )    ; ==> xVarLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let x be defined as in Example 2: x(time,lat,lon). Compute the temporal variance at each latitude/longitude grid point.
   Use NCL's Named Subscripting to reorder the input array such that "time" is the rightmost dimension.
    xVarTime = dim_variance( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xVarTime(nlat,nlon)

    xVarTime = dim_variance_n( x, 0 )                     ; no reordering needed

   If metadata is desired use
    xVarTime = dim_variance_Wrap( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )    ; ==> xVarTime(lat,lon)

    xVarTime = dim_variance_n_Wrap( x(lat|:, lon|:, time|:) )  ; no reordering needed
