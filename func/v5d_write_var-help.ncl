v5d_write_var

   Writes a single 3-dimensional gridded variable to a Vis5D+ format file.

Prototype

        procedure v5d_write_var (
                data [*][*][*] : float
        )

Arguments

   data

   A 3-dimensional float array of gridded data values.

Description

   v5d_write_var()
   writes data to a file in the Vis5D+ format. The data must be a 3D array of grid values where the number of values to
   write is equal to nr * nc * nl(var), ordered as:
     data[row + nr * (col + nc * lev)]

   where row increases from North to South, col(umn) increases from West to East, and lev(el) increases from bottom to top.

   The data is written in a compressed format. See the documentation for v5d_create for a discussion of how to best utilize
   compression settings for your data.

   For further information on Vis5D+ and file formats, see documentation at the Vis5D website.
