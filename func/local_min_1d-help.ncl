local_min_1d

   Determines the relative minima for a 1-dimensional array.

   [new.gif] Available in version 4.2.0.a033 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function local_min_1d (
                x     [*] : numeric,
                cyclic    : logical,
                delta [1] : numeric,
                iopt  [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   x

   A one-dimensional (1D) numeric array.
   cyclic

   A logical value indicating if x is cyclic [=True] or not [=False].
   delta

   Tolerance level (negative). If values are within delta of surrounding values it will not be counted as a local minimum
   value.
   iopt

   An integer value indicating what is to be returned. iopt=0 means return the minimum values. iopt.ne.0 means return the
   indices [subscripts] where minimum values occured.

Return value

   If iopt=0 then a 1D array containing the relative minima is returned. Otherwise a 1D array containing the indices
   (subscripts) where the minima are returned.

Description

   Each element of x is checked against adjacent points to see if the difference exceeds delta.

Examples

   Example 1
           qmin = local_min_1d(q, False, -0.25, 0)
or
           imin = local_min_1d(q, False, -0.25, 1)
           if (.not.ismissing(imin)) then
               qmin = q(imin)
               zmin = z(imin)   ; z where q is at a minimum
           end if
