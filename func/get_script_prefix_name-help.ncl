Examples

   Example 1

   Print the name of the command file provided to NCL. If NCL is invoked as:
% ncl myScript.ncl

   the script itself can announce how NCL was invoked:

  script_name  = get_script_prefix_name()  ; string
  print(script_name)                ; Or, just print(get_script_prefix_name())

   The following string is returned:
myScript

   Example 2

   If no script is provided to NCL, the default missing value for type string is returned. If NCL is invoked as:
% ncl

   the function will return:
  print(get_script_prefix_name())
