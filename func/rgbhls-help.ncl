rgbhls

   Converts RGB color values to HLS.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.0.0 and later.

Prototype

        function rgbhls (
                rgb  : numeric
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   rgb

   An array of Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color values. This array can be of any shape, but the rightmost dimension must be 3
   for specifying the RGB values. The Red, Green, and Blue values are intensities in the range [0.,1.].

Return value

   The returned value is an array of the same dimension and dimension sizes as the input array. The input RGB values will
   have been replaced with their Hue, Lightness, Saturation (HLS) equivalents. If any values in the input array are double
   precision, the returned array will be double precision.

Description

   This function determines the HLS equivalents to RGB color values.

   The returned Hue values will be in the range [0., 360.). A value of (R,0.,0.) in the input RGB space will result in a hue
   of 120. in the HLS space.

   The returned lightness values will be in the range [0.,100.]. Lightness is a measure of the quantity of light - a
   lightness of 0. is black, and a lightness of 100. gives white. The pure hues occur at lightness value 50. The lightness
   should be thought of as a percentage.

   The returned Saturation values will be in the range [0.,100.]. Saturation is a measure of how much white light is mixed
   with the color. Saturation values of 0. represent greys (with a grey value equal to V). Saturation values of 100. are
   fully saturated colors. The hue is technically undefined when S=0; the code leaves H at its previous value when S=0. (0.
   initially). The fully saturated pure hues occur when S=100. and L=50.

begin
  rgb = (/                                       \
           (/(/1., 0., 0./), (/0., 1., 0./)/),   \
           (/(/0., 0., 1./), (/1., 1., 0./)/),   \
           (/(/1., 0., 1./), (/0., 1., 1./)/)    \
        /)
  hls = rgbhls(rgb)
