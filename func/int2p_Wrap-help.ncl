int2p_Wrap

   Interpolates pressure levels to a different set of pressure levels and returns meta data.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function int2p_Wrap (
                pin        : numeric,
                xin        : numeric,
                pout       : numeric,
                linlog [1] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   pin

   An array of any dimensionality containing input pressure levels. If multi-dimensional, the level dimension must be in the
   rightmost position and the values must be monotonically increasing or decreasing.
   xin

   An array of any dimensionality containing the data to be interpolated. Must be the same shape and size as pin.
   pout

   An array of any dimensionality containing output pressure levels with values monotonically increasing or decreasing. If
   multi-dimensional, the level dimension must be in the rightmost dimension and all other dimensions must be the same as
   xin. If one-dimensional, then all of xin will be interpolated to the the same levels. Must have the same units as pin.
   linlog

   A scalar integer indicating the type of interpolation:

   abs(linlog) == 1 --> linear interpolation
   abs(linlog) != 1 --> log interpolation

   If linlog is negative, then extrapolation to levels outside the range of pin will occur. Use extrapolation with caution.

Return value

   The returned array will have the same shape as xin but the rightmost dimension will have the the sizes of the rightmost
   dimension of pout. The return type will be double if pin, xin, or pout are double, float otherwise.

Description

   This function interpolates the values of the rightmost dimension of xin from one set of pressure levels to another set of
   pressure levels. The interpolation can be either linear or log. Extrapolation is optional. Missing values are allowed,
   but they are ignored.

   NOTE: The 'pressure level' terminology is a result of historical usage. This function performs simple linear
   interpolation. The results would be the same if linint1_Wrap (linint1) were used.

   Use int2p_n_Wrap if the level dimension is not the rightmost dimension and reordering is not desired. This function can
   be significantly faster than int2p_Wrap.

Examples

   Example 1

  linlog = 2   ; ln(p) interpolation

  pi =(/ 1000.,925.,850.,700.,600.,500.,400.,300.,250., \
          200.,150.,100.,70.,50.,30.,20.,10. /)

  xi =(/ 28., 23., 18., 10.,  2., -4., -15.,-30.,-40., \
        -52.,-67.,-78.,-72.,-61.,-52.,-48.,-46. /)

  po =(/ 1000.,950.,900.,850.,800.,750.,700.,600.,500., \
          425.,400.,300.,250.,200.,100.,85.,70.,50.,40.,\
           30.,25.,20.,15.,10. /)
  po!0 = "p"
  po@units = "hPa"

  xo = int2p_Wrap (pi,xi,po,linlog)
  print(xo)

   Example 2

  linlog = -1   ; linear interpolation and extrapolation

  pi = (/ 10., 20., 30., 50., 70.,100.,150.,200., \
         250.,300.,400.,500.,600.,700.,850.,925.,1000. /)

  xi =(/-46.,-48.,-52.,-61.,-72.,-78.,-67.,-52., \
        -40.,-30.,-15., -4.,  2., 10., 18., 23., 28. /)

  po =(/ 5., 7., \                    ; extrapolation
        10.,15.,20.,25.,30.,40.,50.,70.,85.,100.,200.,250.,300., \
        400.,425.,500.,600.,700.,750.,800. ,850.,900.,925.,1000., \
        1005.,1012. /)                ; extrapolation
  po!0 = "p"
  po@units = "hPa"

  xo = int2p_Wrap (pi,xi,po,linlog)

   Example 3

   Let p_out be four-dimensional with dimensions time, lat, lon, pout_level. Additionally, p_in and t_in are
   four-dimensional with dimensions time, lat, lon, pin_level. Linearly interpolate with extrapolation.
    linlog = -1
    t_out = int2p_Wrap(p_in,t_in,p_out,linlog)
;   t_out is dimensioned time, lat, lon, pout_level

   Example 4

   Similar to example 3, but p_out is one-dimensional:
  t_out = int2p_Wrap(p_in,t_in,p_out,linlog)
; t_out is interpolated to the uniform set of pressure levels represented by p_in

   Example 5

   Similar to example 3, but none of the input arrays have level in the rightmost dimension and must be reordered

   Note: in V5.2.0, you will be able to use int2p_n_Wrap to avoid having to reorder your data.

; t_out will be dimensioned time, lat, lon, pout_level
  t_out = int2p_Wrap(p_in(time|:,lat|:,lon|:,pin_lev|:), \
                                t_in(time|:,lat|:,lon|:,pin_lev|:), \
                                p_out(time|:,lat|:,lon|:,pout_lev|:), linlog)

; t_out_n will be dimensioned time, pout_level, lat, lon
  t_out_n = int2p_n_Wrap(p_in, \
                                t_in, p_out, linlog, 1)
