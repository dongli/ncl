chartoint

   Coerces values of type character to values of type integer (deprecated; use toint).

Prototype

        function chartoint (
                char_val  : character
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(char_val)] :  integer

Arguments

   char_val

   A character variable of any dimension.

Return value

   The returned value has the same dimensionality as the input variable char_val.

Description

   This function converts an ASCII character (or characters) to its decimal equivalent and returns that as an integer value.
   For example, conversion of the ASCII character 'a' yields the integer 97 as a return value.

   Note: this function and other xxxtoint functions have been superceded by toint.

   This function performs coercion that is not automatically available through the NCL grammar. See the section on coercion
   of types for details on NCL's automatic type conversions.

   This function is an alias for the function charactertointeger. It is identical to that function and is included just for
   people who don't like to type (or like the shorter names).

   Attributes, with the exception of _FillValue, are not propagated by the conversion functions. See Example 2 below.

   Special considerations apply to how missing values are handled in the conversion functions. See Example 2.

Examples

   Example 1

   Converts an array of ASCII characters to their decimal equivalents returned as integers.
begin
  cc = new((/2,3/),character)
  cc(0,0) = integertocharacter (65)  ; 'A'
  cc(0,1) = integertocharacter (66)  ; 'B'
  cc(0,2) = integertocharacter (67)  ; 'C'
  cc(1,0) = integertocharacter (68)  ; 'D'
  cc(1,1) = integertocharacter (69)  ; 'E'
  cc(1,2) = integertocharacter (70)  ; 'F'
  print(cc)  ; Prints the character array cc.
  ff = chartoint(cc)
  print(ff)  ; Prints the decimal equivalents.
end

   Example 2

   Shows how missing values are handled.

begin
;
;  Conversion does not preserve attributes, except missing value.
;  A character missing value is converted to its ASCII equivalent
;  and that converted to a integer when a character missing value
;  is propagated to a integer variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(68)/)
  a@T = "string"
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = chartoint(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has no missing value
;  specified and the original variable does, the missing
;  value of the target variable inherits the missing value of the
;  original variable and the missing values
;  of the original variable are retained in
;  the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(65)/)
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = chartoint(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
;
;  If the target variable has a missing
;  value specified and the original variable
;  has a missing value specified, the missing
;  value of the target variable is retained
;  even when the missing value of the original
;  variable is in the range of the type of the
;  target variable.  Missing values in the
;  original variable are converted to the
;  missing value of the target variable.
;
  a = new(3,character)
  a = (/integertocharacter(66), integertocharacter(67), integertocharacter(65)/)
  a@_FillValue = integertocharacter(65)
  b = new(3,integer,80)
  b = chartoint(a)
  print (b)
  delete(a)
  delete(b)
end
