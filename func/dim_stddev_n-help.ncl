dim_stddev_n

   Computes the sample standard deviation of a variable's given dimension(s) at all other dimensions.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.1.1 and later.

Prototype

        function dim_stddev_n (
                x        : numeric,
                dims [*] : integer
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   x

   A variable of numeric type and any dimensionality.
   dims

   The dimension(s) of x on which to calculate the standard deviation. Must be consecutive and monotonically increasing.

Return value

   The output will be double if x is double, and float otherwise.

   The output dimensionality will be the same as all but the dims's dimensions of the input variable. The dimension rank of
   the input variable will be reduced by the rank of dims.

Description

   The dim_stddev_n function computes the sample standard deviation of all elements of the dimensions indicated by dims for
   each index of the remaining dimensions. Missing values are ignored.

   Technically, this function calculates the sample standard deviation. This means that it divides by one less than the
   total number of non-missing values (1/(N-1)).

   Use dim_stddev_n_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

Examples

   Example 1

   Create a variable q of size (3,5,10) array. Then calculate the sample standard deviation of the rightmost dimension.
    q   = random_uniform(-20,100,(/3,5,10/))
    qStd= dim_stddev_n(q,2)   ;==>  qStd(3,5)

   Example 2

   Let x be of size (ntim,nlat,mlon) and with named dimensions "time", "lat" and "lon", respectively. Then, for each time
   and latitude, the the standard deviation is:
    xStdLon= dim_stddev_n( x, 2 )  ; ==> xStdLon(ntim,nlat)

   Generally, users prefer that the returned variable have metadata associated with it. This can be accomplished via the
   dim_stddev_n_Wrap function
    xStdLon = dim_stddev_n_Wrap( x, 2 )  ; ==> xStdLon(time,lat)

   Example 3

   Let x be defined as in Example 2: x(time,lat,lon). Compute the temporal standard deviation at each latitude/longitude
   grid point.
    xStdTime = dim_stddev_n( x, 0 )    ; ==> xStdTime(nlat,nlon)

   If metadata is desired use
    xStdTime = dim_stddev_n_Wrap( x, 0 )    ; ==> xStdTime(lat,lon)

   Example 4

   Let x be defined as x(time,lev,lat,lon). Compute the temporal standard deviation at each latitude/longitude grid point.
    xStd = dim_stddev_n( x, (/0,1/) ) ; ==> xStd(nlat,nlon)

   Compute the temporal standard deviation at each time/level grid point:
    xStd = dim_stddev_n( x, (/2,3/) ) ; ==> xStd(nlev,ntim)
