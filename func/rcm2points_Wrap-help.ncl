rcm2points_Wrap

   Interpolates data on a curvilinear grid (i.e. RCM, WRF, NARR) to an unstructured grid and retains metadata.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function rcm2points_Wrap (
                lat2d [*][*] : numeric,
                lon2d [*][*] : numeric,
                fi           : numeric,
                lat      [*] : numeric,
                lon      [*] : numeric,
                opt          : integer
        )

        return_val  :  numeric

Arguments

   lat2d

   A two-dimensional array that specifies the latitude locations of fi. The latitudes should proceed from south-to-north.
   lon2d

   A two-dimensional array that specifies the longitude locations of fi. The longitudes should be proceed left to right.
   fi

   A multi-dimensional array to be interpolated. The rightmost two dimensions (latitude, longitude) are the dimensions to be
   interpolated.
   lat

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the latitude coordinates of the locations. Must be monotonically increasing.
   lon

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the longitude coordinates of the locations. Must be monotonically increasing.
   opt

   opt=0 or 1 means use an inverse distance weight interpolation.
   opt=2 means use a bilinear interpolation. (starting with v5.2.1)

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array of the same size as fi except that the rightmost two dimensions have been replaced by the
   number of coordinate pairs (lat,lon). Double if fi is double, otherwise float.

Description

   Interpolates data on a curvilinear grid, such as those used by the RCM (Regional Climate Model), WRF (Weather Research
   and Forecasting) and NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis) models/datasets to an unstructured grid. All of these have
   latitudes that are oriented south-to-north.

   Missing values are allowed and no extrapolation is performed.

   For more robust regridding, see the ESMF regridding examples, which show how to regrid data from and to rectilinear,
   curvilinear, or unstructured grids. Available in version 6.1.0 and later.

Examples

   Example 1

   Interpolate to two locations near Denver, Colorado:
   lonDen = (/-104.867, -102.0/)
   latDen = (/ 39.75,     38.0/)

   f     = addfile ("some_RCM_file.nc", "r")
   lat2d = f->xlat                         ; size = (nlat,nlon)
   lon2d = f->xlon                         ; size = (nlat,nlon)
   x     = f->X

   xDen  = rcm2points_Wrap (lat2d, lon2d, x, lat, lon, 0)

   If the input x was of size:
            x(nlat,nlon) ==>  xDen(2)
       x(ntim,nlat,nlon) ==>  xDen(ntim,2)
  x(ntim,klev,nlat,nlon) ==>  xDen(ntim,klev,2)

   If only one coordinate pair was specified by the user, the result would be returned as a scalar.
