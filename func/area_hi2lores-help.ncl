area_hi2lores

   Interpolates from high resolution rectilinear grids to low resolution recitlinear grids using local area averaging.

Prototype

        function area_hi2lores (
                xi        [*] : numeric,
                yi        [*] : numeric,
                fi            : numeric,
                fiCyclicX [1] : logical,
                wy        [*] : numeric,
                xo        [*] : numeric,
                yo        [*] : numeric,
                foOption  [1] : logical
        )

        return_val  :  float or double

Arguments

   xi

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the X coordinates of the fi array. It must be monotonically increasing. It may be
   unequally spaced. For geo-referenced data, xi is generally the longitude array.
   yi

   A one dimensional array that specifies the Y coordinates of the fi array. This may be a monotonically increasing or
   decreasing array. It may be unequally spaced. For geo-referenced data, yi is generally the latitude array.
   fi

   An array of two or more dimensions. The two rightmost dimensions must of size nyi x nxi, and are the dimensions used in
   the interpolation. If missing values are present, the attribute fi@_FillValue must be set appropriately.
   fiCyclicX

   An option to indicate whether the rightmost dimension of fi is cyclic. This should be set to True only if you have global
   data, but your longitude values don't quite wrap all the way around the globe. For example, if your longitude values go
   from, say, -179.75 to 179.75, or 0.5 to 359.5, then you would set this to True.
   wy

   A scalar or a one dimensional array containing the weights for the yi coordinate. If no weighting is to be used, set to
   1. Otherwise, wy could contain (say) gaussian weights or cosines of the latitude.
   xo

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the X coordinates of the return array. It must be monotonically increasing, but
   may be unequally spaced. For geo-referenced data, xo is generally the longitude array.
   yo

   A one-dimensional array that specifies the Y coordinates of the return array. It may be monotonically increasing or
   decreasing. It may be unequally spaced. For geo-referenced data, yo is generally the latitude array.
   foOption

   If the variable is True then optional arguments may be present. Currently, only one option is available. There is an
   internal parameter, critpc, that specifies the percentage of input grid points within the scope of the low resolution
   grid point that must be present. The default is critpc=100 (percent). This means that if any missing values (_FillValue)
   are encountered the output grid point will be set to _FillValue. The user may change the default value by setting the
   foOption variable attribute, critpc, to any number [0 to 100]. A value of (say) critpc=70 (percent) means that a value
   will be returned if 70% of the high resolution grid points within the scope of the low resolution grid point are
   non-missing.

Return value

   The returned value will have the same dimensions as fi, except for the rightmost two dimensions which will have the same
   dimension sizes as the lengths of yo and xo. The return type will be double if fi is double, and float otherwise.

Description

   area_hi2lores uses local area averaging to interpolate from a high resolution rectilinear grid to a low resolution
   rectilinear grid. The method accounts for fractional contributions of the input high resolution grid points to the scope
   of each low resolution grid point. This is not strictly conservative remapping. However, it is reasonably quick and
   yields grids that are adequate for most purposes. Use the SCRIP (Spherical Coordinate Remapping and Interpolation
   Package) for conservative remapping.

   In default mode, if missing values (_FillValue) are present in the input high resolution grid points within the scope of
   a low resolution grid point, a missing value will be returned. Use the opt@critpc to alter this behavior.

   Note: If it is desired to go from a low resolution to a high resolution grid use bilinear resolution (linint2,
   linint2_Wrap) or, possibly the spherical harmonic regridders if the grids are global.

   If the output coordinates (xo,yo) are outside those of the input coordinates (xi,yi), then the fo values at those
   coordinates will be set to missing (i.e. no extrapolation is performed).

   Use area_hi2lores_Wrap if retention of metadata is desired.

   For more robust regridding, see the ESMF regridding examples, which show how to regrid data from and to rectilinear,
   curvilinear, or unstructured grids. Available in version 6.1.0 and later.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume fi is dimensioned niy x nix (100 x 400), and that the rightmost dimension is not to be treated as cyclic. The
   returned array will be of size noy x nox, where noy and nox are the sizes of the one-dimensional arrays xo and yo:
  fo = area_hi2lores (xi,yi,fi, False, 1,  xo,yo, False)

   Example 2

   Consider high resolution grid, fi(ntim,nlat,mlon), where nlat=400 and mlon=1440. The input latitudes span -49.875 to
   +49.875 (degrees_north). The input longitudes span -179.875 to +179.875 (degrees_east). The grid is cyclic and missing
   values are present. Create a 2x3 grid over the same spatial range using the default critpc [=100%] and then a second grid
   that requires only say) 50% of the high resolution grid points be non-missing.
  f = addfile ("foo.nc", "r")
  p = f->PRC
  printVarSummary( p )

  LON = fspan(-178.5,178.5, 120)
  LAT = fspan(-48,48, 49)
  po  = area_hi2lores (p&lon,p&lat, p , True, 1,  LON, LAT, False)  ; (ntim,49,120)

  opt = True
  opt@critpc = 50                ; require only 50% of the values to be present
  PO  = area_hi2lores (p&lon,p&lat, p , True, 1,  LON, LAT, opt  )  ; (ntim,49,120)
