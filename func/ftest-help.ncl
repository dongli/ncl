ftest

   Applies F-test for variances and returns an estimate of the statistical significance.

Prototype

        function ftest (
                var1    : numeric,
                s1      : numeric,
                var2    : numeric,
                s2      : numeric,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(var1)] :  float or double

Arguments

   var1
   var2

   Scalars or arrays of any dimension (they must be the same dimensionality as each other). They represent the variances
   calculated from two samples (i.e. sample variances).
   s1
   s2

   Must be the same dimensionality as var1 and var2, or else scalars. If the data within the two samples are significantly
   autocorrelated, then s1 and s2 should contain the equivalent sample sizes. It is best if the samples sizes are "large"
   (i.e. > 30).
   opt

   Currently not used. Set to zero.

Return value

   The output array will be the same dimensionality as var1. If either of var1 or var2 are of type double, the returned
   values will be of type double. Otherwise, the returned values will be of type float.

Description

   The F-test uses the ratio of variances (F=var1/var2 or F=var2/var1) where the numerator is the larger of the two
   variances. The F-test tests the null hypothesis that the sample variances are from the same population (i.e. H0:
   var1=var2). Rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e. acceptance of the alternative hypothesis) indicates that the sample
   variances are from two different populations. Note that values much smaller/larger than 1 indicate that the variances may
   be from different populations. Hence, a two-tailed significance test is used.

   As noted by vonStorch and Zwiers(1998), the F-test is "not particularly powerful". One way to increase the power (at the
   cost of increased greater risk) is to test a critical significance level of 0.1 (i.e. 10%).

   The value(s) returned by ftest represent estimates of the statistical significance. Commonly, values of 0.10 or less are
   used as critical levels. Note: the user should specify the critical significance level prior to the calculation.

Examples

   Example 1

   Assume X and Y are one-dimensional arrays (they need not be the same size). Assume each of the values within X and Y are
   independent. Use the F-test to test if X and Y have the same population variance:

  siglvl = 0.05              ; critical level
  varX = variance (X)
  varY = variance (Y)
  sX   = dimsizes (X)        ; X and Y can be of
  sY   = dimsizes (Y)        ; different sizes
  prob = ftest(varX,sX,varY,sY,0)

   prob will be a scalar containing the significance and will range between zero and one. Let's say varX = 72, sX = 31, varY
   = 18, and sY = 9. Then prob will be = 0.046 which is less than the critical level. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected
   and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.

   Example 2

   Assume varX, sX, varY and sY are dimensioned nlat x mlon. Then:
  alpha = 100.*(1. - ftest(varX,sX,varY,sY, ))

   will yield alpha dimensioned nlat x mlon. A significance of 0.05 returned by ftest would yield 95% for alpha. This is
   often done for plotting.

   Example 3

   Assume stdX and stdY are dimensioned 12 x nlat x mlon and represent interannual variabilities (represented here as
   standard deviations) for each month. Assume sx and sy are scalars containing the number of years used to calculate the
   variances. (Generally, there is no significant year-to-year autocorrelation of monthly data [e.g. successive Januaries].)
  prob = ftest(stdX^2, sX, stdY^2, sY, 0)

   will yield prob dimensioned 12 x nlat x mlon. Note that the standard deviations were squared to produce variances as
   required by the ftest function.

   Example 4

   Assume x and y are dimensioned time x lat x lon where "time", "lat", "lon" are dimension names.
    1. Use NCL's named dimensions to reorder in time;
    2. calculate the temporal variances using the dim_variance function;
    3. specify a critical significance level to test the lag-one auto-correlation coefficient and determine the (temporal)
       number of equivalent sample sizes in each grid point using equiv_sample_size;
    4. [optional] estimate a single global mean equivalent sample size using wgt_areaave;
    5. specify a critical significance level for the F-test and test if the variances are different at each grid point.

                                  (1)
  xtmp = x(lat|:,lon|:,time|:)       ; reorder but do it only once [temporary]
  ttmp = y(lat|:,lon|:,time|:)

                                  (2)
  xVar = dim_variance (xtmp)         ; calculate variances
  yVar = dim_variance (ytmp)
                                  (3)
  sigr = 0.05                        ; critical sig lvl for r
  xEqv = equiv_sample_size (xtmp, sigr,0)  ; xEqv(nlat,nlon)
  yEqv = equiv_sample_size (ytmp, sigr,0)
                                  (4)
                                   ; xN and N will be scalars
  xN   = wgt_areaave (xEqv, wgty, 1., 0)    ; wgty could be gaussian weights
  yN   = wgt_areaave (yEqv, wgty, 1., 0)
                                  (5)
  sigf = 0.10                        ; any value of prob<sigf is significant
  prob = ftest(xVar,xN, yVar,yN, False)
