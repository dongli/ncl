merge_levels_sfc

   Merges a multiple level variable with the corresponding surface variable.

   [new.gif] Available in version 5.2.0 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function merge_levels_sfc (
                x       : numeric      ,
                xsfc    : numeric   ,
                opt [1] : integer
        )

Arguments

   x

   An array of any the following shapes: x(lev), x(time,lev), x(lev,lat,lon), x(time,lev,lat,lon) or
   x(case,time,lev,lat,lon). It is required that the dimensions be named.
   xsfc

   An array of the one less rank than x. The shapes corresponding to the argument x: xsfc[1], xsfc(time), xsfc(lat,lon),
   xsfc(time,lat,lon) or xsfc(case,time,lat,lon). It is required that the dimensions be named.
   opt

   An integer:
   opt greater than or equal to zero if x is top-to-bottom ordering.
   opt less than zero if x is bottom-to-top ordering.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array of the same rank as x but with one additional level.

Description

   Commonly, models and reanalysis datasets provide variable with multiple levels, say, x(time,lev,lat,lon) and a separate
   corresponding surface variable xsfc(time,lat,lon). In some applications, it may be useful to merge these into one
   variable. See the Example

Examples

   Example 1

   Consider x(ntim,klev,nlat,mlon) and xsfc(ntim,nlat,mlon) where "x" is ordered bottom-to-top.
      xNew = merge_levels_sfc(x, xsfc, -1)    ; xNew(ntim,klev+1,nlat,mlon)

   Example 2

   See Example 4 at hydro. This illustrates one use of the merge_levels_sfc function.
